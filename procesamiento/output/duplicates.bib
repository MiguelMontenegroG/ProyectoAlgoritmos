In this study we used synchronization tapping task as a model system, and negative asynchrony phenomenon where the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was analyzed as an example of the anticipation. Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.},

Second order linear system sliding curves eliminate the reaching phase and consequently and associated problems of load sensitivity and high demanded torque. Moreover, the chattering usually present in the sliding phase also disappears with the new control law. Simulation results show a negligible coupling between axes, thus enabling an easier and more efficient controller adjustment. It is also shown that the controller parameter set can be easily adjusted, and there is a large set of possible quasi-optimal values. This is of utmost importance, when one thinks of the industrial applications of this type of algorithms. Experiments were developed based on the position control problem. Nevertheless, generalization to the trajectory tracking problem is trivial. In either case the controller computational requirements are low, thus well adapted to today},

 abstract = {Previous terrorist attacks, infrastructure failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that states face in preparing for civil contingencies. One aspect of this is that the agencies which typically coordinate the protection of critical infrastructures have a national responsibility. However, the impact of particular failures is often focused at a local or regional level. For example, Hurricane Katrina was most acutely felt in the City of New Orleans (over 350,000 people affected), with concentrations in suburban Jefferson Parish (175,000) and St. Bernard Parish (53,000) and along the Mississippi Coast (54,000). The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the UK floods of 2007 also show how multiple localised contingencies can occur at the same time. National infrastructure protection agencies must, therefore, be prepared to provide simultaneous help to multiple local agencies. It is for this reason that national civil protection bodies provide national guidance but then devolve responsibility for the implementation of contingency plans to a local level. Unfortunately, many of the regional groups who are responsible for infrastructure protection have little or no idea about the detailed inter-relationships that exist between their own local infrastructures. For example, in the UK},

A Bayesian approach seems to best model human reasoning over structures, relations and links, and it is possible to provide a detailed computational account of how a number of basic structural forms can be inferred from various types of data (feature sets, similarity matrices, relations). In the literature some algorithms have been proposed that generate candidate model structures from graph grammars, compute the probability of the data given each candidate model, and identify the model with maximum posterior probability given the data. The structural representation, being generated by algorithms comparable to human thinking (according to the cognitive sciences community) should be also easily understandable and usable by analysts for further investigation.},

Control is a fundamental function of the living organism that works in all aspects of the life. Various control mechanisms are ubiquitously built-in at all levels of body structures of living organisms and work all the time to support the life. They are diversely different from one to another with different material bases and structures, but there are many reasons to think that have some common ground and design principles. It is argued that a unified approach is exploited by focusing on a biological way of dealing with environmental changes to investigate various control mechanisms of living organisms.The notion of compound control is proposed as a common principle of biological control based on the transdisciplinary nature of control theory.},

It eliminates the need for a checking phase in an MC algorithm. There can be many interpretations for the concept of adding Immunity to P systems. In this paper, one interpretation is introduced in which Immunity is interpreted as a set of rules that protects membranes against generation or evolution of unwanted objects. Hence; it is guaranteed that if the system developed an answer then it is correct otherwise the final step will be reached with no membranes.},

However, with progress of information technology, computer simulation gets a powerful method to handle models, and individual-based and more procedural model such as an agent-based model can be another alternative in modeling. This study discusses an agent-based model of flue infection developed for teaching science and computer in a project-based learning (PBL) course in a senior high school. Course practice showed that the agent-based approach was effective in learning of modeling and simulation by experience.},

 abstract = {Forecasting model is a systematical tool to improve the performance of the demand forecasting in supply chain. With the incessant innovation of technology, new products have been developed continuously. Therefore, improving the forecasting accuracy of the new product has become a primary concern for many companies. Most of them in SCM care how to predict the new products sales in the future. Bass model was usually used to obtain the trend of the new product forecast by many reach in the past. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a method which can consider the past case to transform the useful historical experience into the case at present. To address this concern, we developed a demand forecasting methodology that combines CBR and common forecasting model. In the first stage, we use Bass model to obtain the new product sales forecasts. In the second stage, we obtain second forecast using CBR inference method to find the most similar curve in the past series. The final stage, we combine the forecast from Bass and CBR to development the hybrid forecast. Several cases are used to demonstrate the hybrid model how to improve the performance of new product forecast. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of new product forecast.},

It is embedding computers in our daily lives to create an active and intelligent environment [1]. This is future phase of computers, which is beyond the desktop and notebook environment, where we are currently in and we are progressively heading deeper inside this new phase. In Ubiquitous Computing we mainly focus on computer being integral part of human such that we are unaware of their presence. Computer scientists are focusing hard on ways how the interaction between human and computer can be simplified. We can think of an era where we are surrounded with over hundreds of computers each doing a unique task irrespective of location and time and keeping human unaware. In this article we explore about the evolution of ubiquitous computing from its origin and history, its architecture, role of privacy and integration of privacy in system design, its Features and Technical Challenges. Ubiquitous computing is the third wave in computing, which has begun just now. Ubicomp is a field where we require considerable efforts to match up the current technological developments. According to the view of Computer Scientists and Engineers in future we will be having such a technological advancement in this field that will amaze the world.},

 abstract = {There are a growing number of modeling techniques and algorithms for creating and modifying tree structures, both quickly and realistically. Many of these tools are part of larger software packages used for architecture or landscaping designs. In these tools the tree models are static and come from a library selection. In other areas, such as 3D modeling and design in film and animation, the tree creation tools are more open for artistic creativity and freedom of control. Much research has also been done on growing trees that are sensitive to some environment. That is, growing tree models where genus type, and natural and artificial environment factors are taken into heavy consideration. In this paper, we present an approach that facilitates user creativity while still providing a realistic response to environment factors. Our system adapts the Space Colonization Tree Modeling approach to allow for continued branch addition as well as environmental interaction. Feedback from experienced modelers who participated in a user study revealed that our approach generated the tree skeleton structures they intended and also provided realistic interaction with the environment.},

We propose a new way to model and animate topological changes, allowing the programmer to design any type of topological changes and animation mapping. This model is based on organizing the complex modeling activity into three clearly defined simpler sub-activities: 1) point-based animation, which enables a wide variety of possible temporal phenomena; 2) topological-based modeling, which makes it possible to manage a wide variety of shape-independent topologies and topological transformations; 3) free, non predetermined, association between both, and 4) final output of an animated geometrical model exhibiting any complex behavior. We experimented the proposed method by modeling tearing effects on deformable garments, on rifts and crack effects on 3D objects, and finally by modeling imaginary and paradoxical topological transformations associated with realistic Physics-based animation. Besides improving the consistency and the robustness of the modeling process of such complex phenomena, our aim is also to offer a user-centered programming environment to the Computer Graphics and Animation programmers and designers, to enlarge their modeling and experimentation abilities, and to stimulate their creativity.},

 abstract = {Autonomous swarm control, which is expected to be able to handle multiple unmanned vehicles (UxVs), is an important technology that can be applied to many operations and incorporated in many systems. For operations in real environments, we have to consider severe conditions under which communications between UxVs may be inadequate and the environment changes unexpectedly. In addition to optimality, adaptability (meaning robustness to severe and unexpected conditions) is important in real situations. However, there are no quantitative benchmarks for algorithms to have both optimality and adaptability. Here, to reconcile optimality and adaptability, we have developed an “autonomous and adaptive control”. The distinctive features of this algorithm is that it simply uses the purposes of a system, such as efficiencies, to control elements and it has a distributed optimization architecture without a centralized control unit. We think that it is promising for autonomous swarm control with optimality and adaptability in real environments. In this paper, we benchmark several swarm control algorithms including our own. We compare two conventional algorithms with ours in a scenario involving a continuous search operation where the UxVs keep moving and searching. We also devise performance indicators for this operation and evaluate the algorithms in terms of them. The results obtained from computational simulations show that our algorithm maintains the efficiency of the search operation at a high level. That means the algorithm is a promising approach for achieving both optimality and adaptability.},
