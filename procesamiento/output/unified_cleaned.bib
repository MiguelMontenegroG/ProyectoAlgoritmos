In the hashing layer of the designed system, one of the similarity-preserve hashing is used to convert the input samples to hashed data which dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the data but keeps the similarity information. In the clustering layer, hashed samples are divided into different clusters, which can be considered a feature extraction process based on the similarity of the hash value. In the associate memory layer, each cluster will be trained as an associate memory to store the hashed data stably. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is used to perform the decision-making process to classify the testing sample without complicated mathematical computation. In the simulation, we are able to achieve a good result, especially on small numbers of training data.},

 abstract = {Affective interaction with virtual humans can enhance the quality of user experience in virtual reality. It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.},

Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved. Psychometric qualities of ESCAS (Chinese) were examined, and the effect of coding attitudes on CT cognitive performance was analyzed with linear regression. Results showed that ESCAS (Chinese) was a valid and reliable attitudinal scale, and coding interest could predict CT performance. Future directions for the study were discussed.},

 abstract = {The impact of new technology on higher vocational education(HVE) has attracted the attention of many domestic scholars. The current direction of education informatization research is mostly smart classrooms. Therefore, schools will inevitably promote education informatization through the use of smart classrooms, and smart classrooms with classroom teaching(CT), teacher-student activities, and Internet + education will also become the core. This article uses experimental analysis and questionnaire survey methods to experiment on the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE, compare and analyze the learning effects of the experimental and control classes of computer professional courses, and investigate and analyze their attitudes to the application of the intelligent classroom model. The experimental survey results show that the outstanding students in the experimental class has more students than that in the control class, and the learning effect is better than the traditional mode in the smart CT mode of deep learning, and most students in the experimental class prefer the use of the smart classroom mode. It can be concluded that it is necessary to study the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE. In the intelligent classroom teaching system, data mining, K-means algorithm and MapReduce framework are comprehensively applied. By analyzing various behavioral data of students in school, the potential value behind these data is mined, so as to improve the construction of intelligent classroom and promote the improvement of higher vocational education.},

In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study.},

 abstract = {Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.},

 abstract = {The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.},

A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions.},

This ambiguity is foundational to computer science and has its roots in the response of university computer centers to the commercialization of computing in the mid-1950s. University computing experts developed an understanding of the activity of computing disentangled from the computer itself, a conceptual shift that went together with a parallel process of dematerialization of the notion of computer. These transformations were facilitated by the ascendance of a high modernist agenda in the sciences in the United States. University computing experts embraced the high modernist agenda and developed analogies across programs, notations, and a notion of the computer now understood as a model of computation. This immaterial conflation of notations, programs, and representations of the machine, would become one of the core tenets of computer science.},

At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences.

 abstract = {In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models’ strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.},

In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.},

In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles.

 abstract = {Several practical engineering optimization problems are computationally demanding, requiring a large amount of computer time, processing power, and memory. These challenges can be mitigated by human-engineered systems exhibiting intelligent behavior. With the evolution of high-speed digital computers, the use of computational intelligence (CI) techniques has increased rapidly. According to Bezdek [1], “A system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the artificial intelligence (AI) sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptivity, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.” Another definition, by Engelbrecht [2], states that “CI is the study of adaptive mechanisms that enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. These mechanisms include those Artificial Intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate.” Thus, CI is the general term used to classify all such nature-inspired methodologies and their associated theories and applications. The five important paradigms of the CI technique are artificial neural networks (ANNs), swarm intelligence (SI), evolutionary computation (EC), and fuzzy systems (FSs). The origin of each technique can be connected to a natural system; for example, an ANN imitates the biological neural system. SI models the behavior of organisms living in swarms, whereas EC models the natural evolution system. Similarly, an FS originates from human thinking processes. Many of the problems involved in designing next-generation systems can be resolved using these CI techniques or their combinations.},

In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality.},

This kind of grammars are inherently visual and they allow the implementation of computational mechanisms to either synthesize or analyze designs of visual languages, including the detection of emergent sub-shapes languages. They have obvious applications to design, including for marketing. The infrastructure presented, together with the algorithm to which it gives support, the latter proposed in another, twin, paper, is a core component of a system, described in our past work, that allows users to build their own shape grammars and experiment with and use them.},

 abstract = {Contribution: This study represents the first systematic attempt to develop Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) integrated project-based learning (PBL) as a transdisciplinary teaching method for fostering students’ creativity and computational thinking (CT) skills. Background: With the growing importance of creativity and CT skills in the modern world, there is a need for innovative teaching methods that can effectively nurture these abilities in students. This study explores the potential of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need. Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students’ creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students’ creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth.},

Responding to the common perception to develop those thinking skills in all learners, and indeed in the entire population, we developed a MOOC on computational thinking. The course advocates the development of computational thinking skills in every human being, at any age, and in any subject matter, emphasizing the common, essential computational thinking skills: problem decomposition, abstraction, and generalization. Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning. We present preliminary findings from research we conducted during the first two MOOC cycles with about 1,600 learners. Specifically, quantitative and qualitative data analysis of students},

These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.},

To ubiquitously cover the MTDs working in rural and disastrous areas, satellite communications become indispensable, while mobile edge computing (MEC) also plays an increasingly crucial role. Their sophisticated integration enables wide-area edge intelligence which promises to facilitate globally-distributed customized services. In this article, we present typical use cases of integrated satellite-MEC networks and discuss the main challenges therein. Inspired by the protein structure and the systematic engineering methodology, we propose three minimal integrating structures, based on which a complex integrated satellite-MEC network can be treated as their extension and combination. We discuss the unique characteristics and key problems of each minimal structure. Accordingly, we establish an on-demand network orchestration framework to enrich the hierarchy of network management, which further leads to a process-oriented network optimization method. On that basis, a case study is utilized to showcase the benefits of on-demand network orchestration and process-oriented network optimization. Finally, we outline potential research issues to envision a more intelligent, more secure, and greener integrated network.},

Previous studies predominantly have used Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer models trained with the pitch, timing, and amplitude of scripted musical notes to generate new background music sequences. In this research, we proposed a novel training procedure using simple Gated Recurrent Units as the basic architecture of the model, which is trained with compacted high-dimensional vectors based on raw long audio sequences. Our experiments showed promising results, even when executed on low-end hardware. Our best model achieved a cumulative moving average of the loss of around 0.016, and the model successfully produced interesting background music based on vocal sound.},

 abstract = {The growing concern about offshore chip manufacturing has created considerable interest in solutions that can ensure the integrity and security of chips. Among various solutions, split manufacturing has received a lot of attention due to its security guarantees. With the recent emergence of new heterogeneous manufacturing technologies, including chiplet-based systems, there is a new opportunity for revisiting the design considerations for split manufacturing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by chiplet-based systems and improve various metrics, such as security, performance, and overhead.This work improves the state-of-the-art in secure chip manufacturing by proposing a new split manufacturing scheme. The key idea is to exploit the capabilities provided by chiplet integration technology for designing a new hybrid split manufacturing scheme that includes both vertical and horizontal splitting. Unlike existing vertical-only split manufacturing mechanisms, that target obfuscation of interconnections by splitting the design at a specific metallization layer into two portions, the proposed hybrid method increases trust by exploiting the chiplet paradigm shift, specifically, breaking the design into sub-designs, each represented by chiplets (independently fabricated), and obfuscating interconnections among them. The proposed obfuscation mechanism targets systems that exploit the chiplet technology to obtain important performance advantages, thus any chiplet-related overhead is not due to obfuscation. We evaluate our method using several experiments and compare it with the state-of-the-art using standard metrics, including area, power, delay, wirelength, and trust. Compared to conventional split manufacturing, our hybrid method achieves up to 245× higher trust, while exhibiting negligible overhead.},

 abstract = {As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre- and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities.},

This has inspired ideas for new lesson plans, instructional strategies, teacher guidance, and, most importantly, new approaches to grading these skills. Aim: This article presents the results of a systematic review initially focused on identifying the various ways of assessing CT in school and their relationship to relevant CT skills. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works. Conclusions: The evaluation of CT in the school requires multiple approaches; it is a challenge to have a single method or strategy to evaluate everything that CT implies.},

 abstract = {What role do affective feelings (feelings/emotions/moods) play in adaptive behaviour? What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling.},

Despite some institutions’ efforts in this regard, multiple studies suggest that progress could be expedited through digital technology, leaving room for improvement. Numerous Higher Educational Institutions still need sustainable practices within their building infrastructure. Hence, this research project was developed to create an intelligent model for monitoring the carbon footprint of buildings within Higher Educational Institutions. The study focused on the Bandung Institute of Technology facilities, which encountered similar challenges stemming from various aspects contributing to the overall carbon footprint. This research effectively managed energy consumption by implementing design thinking, encompassing electricity and water usage, and reducing emissions. Furthermore, the application of this model provided valuable insights into both current and projected energy consumption and emission production. It also assessed the sustainability status of these buildings and enhanced the efficiency of information dissemination in energy reporting processes. This, in turn, facilitated the implementation of proactive measures for emission management not only at the Bandung Institute of Technology but also in other Higher Educational Institution buildings sharing similar characteristics.},

This article presents the results of theoretical studies on the formalization of human intellectual activity in relation to the field of cognitive sciences. The subject of the study is the concept of sense. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the development of artificial intelligence, in which the category of sense plays one of the leading roles. For humans, the concept of sense is relevant, both from a world outlook point of view and from the standpoint of cognitive science. However, the problem lies in the fact that sense is an axiomatic concept and therefore is difficult to formalize. There are various formulations of the sense at a qualitative level, but to solve practical problems in the field of cognitive science, a quantitative definition is required, that is, a description of the sense from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the study is to mathematically substantiate the concept of sense using the theory of algorithms and, as a consequence, to prove the possibility of calculating the sense. This paper uses the philosophical concept of the relationship of participation (author S. E. Yachin) and the Kolmogorov Complexity of Algorithms (author A. N. Kolmogorov). The principle of relativization, laid down in the formulation of the relationship of participation, served as the foundation for the development of an algorithmic approach to the calculation of sense. At a hypothetical level, an assumption is made that the additive constant accompanying the algorithmic calculations of information can serve as a measure of the amount of sense. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, a theorem on the computability of sense has been formulated and proved. The results obtained may be of interest to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science.},

Generative design (GD) aims to accelerate the design process compared to manual design, since GD allows exploring and exploiting the vast design space more efficiently. In the field of robotics, however, relevant research focuses mostly on the generation of fully-actuated open chain kinematics, which is trivial in mechanical engineering perspective. Within this paper, we address the problem of generative design of closed-chain linkage mechanisms. A GD algorithm has to be able to generate meaningful mechanisms which satisfy conditions of existence. We propose an optimization-driven algorithm for generation of planar closed-chain linkages to follow a predefined trajectory. The algorithm creates an unlimited range of physically reproducible design alternatives that can be further tested in simulation. These tests could be done in order to find solutions that satisfy extra criteria, e.g., desired dynamic behavior or low energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is called “respawn” since it builds a new linkage after the ancestor has been tested in a virtual environment in pursuit for the optimal solution. To show that the algorithm is general enough, we show a set of generated linkages that can be used for a wide class of robots.},

 abstract = {Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners},

 abstract = {While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.},

The method used for the assessment of employee performance evaluation is the center of ranking and ranking order using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), so as to produce rankings that can be compared with the best alternative results with weighted values generated by each method. To apply the MAUT approach in decision support systems, the determination of employee performance evaluation assessment has the criteria of initiative, team working ability, communication skills, discipline, responsibility, creativity and innovation, customer service, and commitment to company values. This research aims at evaluating employee performance using MAUT and PIPRECIA-S in order to weight the criteria based on the assessment of decision makers more objectively. Based on the process of completing the application of the MAUT method using PIPRECIA-S weighting in the assessment of employee performance evaluation, among the 6 employees as the subjects of the research, the best performance was obtained by employee 4 with a final score of 0.435 as rank 1, and rank 2 was obtained by Employee 1 with a final score of 0.328, while rank 3 was obtained by Employee 3 with a final score of 0.251.},

 abstract = {The computing in the network (COIN) paradigm is a promising solution that leverages unused network resources to perform tasks to meet computation-demanding applications, such as the metaverse. In this vein, we consider the partial computation offloading problem in the metaverse for multiple subtasks in a COIN environment to minimize energy consumption and delay while dynamically adjusting the offloading policy based on the changing computational resource status. The problem is NP-hard, and we transform it into two subproblems: the task-splitting problem (TSP) on the user side and the task-offloading problem (TOP) on the COIN side. We model the TSP as an ordinal potential game and propose a decentralized algorithm to obtain its Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we model the TOP as a Markov decision process and propose the double deep Q-network (DDQN) to solve for the optimal offloading policy. Unlike the conventional DDQN algorithm, where intelligent agents sample offloading decisions randomly within a certain probability, the COIN agent explores the NE of the TSP and the deep neural network. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the proposed model approach allows the COIN agent to update its policies and make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance over time compared to the traditional baseline.},

At the same time, the exploration and exploitation of intrinsic musical structures and sequences, a timeless endeavor, continue to captivate scholars and practitioners alike. In this context, the fusion of computational techniques with music analysis emerges as a natural progression. One of the pivotal crossroads in this convergence is the identification of musical phrase boundaries, pivotal demarcations that underpin the organizational fabric of a musical composition. This article pioneers an inventive approach to address the challenge of detecting these musical phrase boundaries, harnessing the power of artificial neural networks. However, the innovation does not stop there; the pinpointed phrase boundaries undergo a comprehensive dissection utilizing pattern mining techniques. The focus of this analysis is on unveiling recurrent motifs and classifying phrases into coherent clusters, predicated on the repetitions and similarities exposed through these neural network-driven techniques. This exploration was conducted using an extensive repository of folk songs, a treasure trove of foundational musical expressions that indelibly shape the stylistic contours of musical compositions.

The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.},

We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses.

 abstract = {Health care is the improvement of health through the avoidance and cure of diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a substantial health issue, ranking as the eighth leading cause of death and the tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both genders. This research aims to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the presence of CKD, which affects people worldwide. Timely identification of CKD is crucial to prevent it from progressing to its final and most critical phase. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, are used in this study for the prediction of CKD. Various health parameters such as age, albumin level, and more are used as input into each ML algorithm to predict the presence of CKD. Data preprocessing is carried out to improve the quality of the data for more accurate prediction. The data is analyzed to uncover the connections between CKD health parameters and their impact on the occurrence of CKD. This research further examines the influence of different train and test data ratios on the accuracy of the employed algorithms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and more are employed to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in making predictions. Random Forest stood out as the most accurate algorithm, with a score of 96.25%. Naive Bayes and XGBoost demonstrated the highest sensitivity, achieving a perfect score of 100%.},

This exciting research area has significant potential to advance automation processes and improve human-machine interfaces in various applications. The emergence of faster computers, affordable high-performance video cameras, and the need for automated analysis of videos has led to an increase in the popularity of object tracking, a critical task in computer vision. The process of video analysis typically encompasses object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis. Object tracking involves four main aspects choosing the suitable object representation, selecting features for tracking, detecting the object, and tracking the object. Object tracking algorithms find applications in different domains, including vehicle navigation, video indexing, and surveillance that are automated. The objective of the paper is to create a software application for smart wearable devices that utilizes computer vision to track finger gestures in the air, functioning as a motion-to-text converter for air-writing. The technology will facilitate communication for people by enabling them to generate text for multiple purposes, like sending emails and messages, through intermittent gestures. This is a productive means of communication that curbs the usage of laptops and mobiles, making it particularly beneficial for individuals who are deaf.},

 abstract = {Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.},

 abstract = {This full paper presents the instillation of computational thinking (CT) in undergraduate students across multiple disciplines through an adaptive gamified e-learning platform. In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students. This will help smoothly transition students into programming-relevant modules, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning.},

Yet, its use for teaching programming with university-level non-STEM audiences has not been researched so far. This work presents a new educational activity designed for teaching programming to non-STEM university-level audiences. The key aspect is a separation of teaching programming concepts and programming language and; therefore, complexity reduction in learning. The concepts are introduced using educational robotics and later on students learn how to use the concepts in the context of the Python programming language. Two teaching approaches, direct instruction and productive failure, along with a capstone challenge are deployed and their relationship to educational robotics is observed.},

In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion. In the post-survey, most participants acknowledge that the immersive environment is helpful when learning abstract subjects.},

In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed.},

BLEU scores for each of these were (a) 0.5 for the n-gram model, (b) 0.1 for LSTM and GRU and, (c) 0.6 for the GPT-2 model, which was the highest overall score. In addition to the BLEU score, other metrics such as rhyming score and human evaluation were considered for evaluating the generated poetry. This research is the first to use transformer-based models for Urdu poetry generation, which enables aspiring poets to learn from and be inspired by the rich tradition of Urdu poetry.},

 abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for Computer Programming students these abilities are crucial. Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children’s education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain’s learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master’s Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.},

To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way.

 abstract = {With the progress of science and technology, quantum computing plays an increasingly important role in various fields, solving the traditional arithmetic bottleneck. In the financial field, credit scoring is the core of the lending industry and one of the most common risk management tools. Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.},

 abstract = {The significance of incorporating ethics education in engineering programs has grown considerably in recent times, especially within domains such as computer science, software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. In response to this demand, a pedagogical activity was developed and executed to facilitate students in applying ethical theories to occupational and societal challenges while enhancing their critical thinking abilities. This activity involves students participating in a debate where they are assigned a moral stance to uphold and must utilize one of the ethical theories explored in class to bolster their case. This paper offers an in-depth account of the conception and execution of this educational activity, as well as the encouraging results observed. Furthermore, the paper showcases the scenario utilized in the activity, which outlines a professional conundrum in the realm of Computer Engineering. The findings of this educational activity indicate its efficacy as a teaching instrument for ethics in engineering programs, with potential applicability to other engineering fields. By integrating such pedagogical activities into engineering programs, educators can empower students with essential ethical values and skills to tackle intricate ethical issues in their professional and social spheres while also fostering critical thinking and encouraging dialogue among students.},

Various real-time applications rely on the 5G era to fulfil the baseline service requirements. These 5G network communications deploy different cryptosystems to handle the security issues between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme},

The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.},

 abstract = {The solution of a typical programming task involves algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, decomposition, and abstraction skills. These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don’t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.},

However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning.},

Compared to traditional learning modes, using mobile phones for learning is not limited by geography or learning forms, and has great freedom in time and space. This is an informal remote teaching based on digitization and mobile computer devices. Autonomous learning breaks through the limitations of traditional learning models and enables learners to better utilize their fragmented time for learning. Based on the above issues, this article discussed how to build a mobile assisted language translation intelligent recommendation system using NPL (Natural Language Processing) technology. Finally, experimental data showed that the system designed in this article had the smallest parameter size but the shortest training time, with values of only 16M and 5.649min/epoch, respectively. This indicated that the language translation system designed in this article had strong advantages, which can reduce the size of model parameters and thus reduce the training time of the model. The experiment verified the superiority of the mobile assisted language translation system based on NPL.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of modern wireless communication, communication has become more and more convenient and widely popular. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks from third parties. During the establishment of UAV networks, given the limited computing power and storage resources of UAVs, traditional encryption methods may adversely affect their performance. Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques to extract channel features to increase the adaptability of key distribution. This approach is expected to provide strong support for the security and reliability of UAV networks.},

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.},

Future engineers will need to apply modeling to solve problems that emerge in professional activities building on the school primary engineering learning. The construction of physical processes 3D models in computer environments can aid in the development of engineering thinking and digital training. This requires the electronic educational resources design and the development of suitable methods. The collaboration between pedagogical and engineering universities can facilitate the accomplishment of these tasks provided with methodical basis and a consolidation of the universities scientific and practical developments in the network interaction. One of the popular areas for training future engineers is distance project design where tasks are distributed among several performers. The issue of interdisciplinary design of electronic educational resources to ensure the quality of engineering training in technological profiles in schools is significant for the theory and practice of innovation in engineering education, pedagogical methodology and technology, and digital didactics. The proposed methods include computer modeling of physical processes in engineering (using materials science example), pedagogical design, and educational outcomes analysis. The paper describes the results of experimental work on organizing interdisciplinary projects for the development of electronic educational resources for school engineering learning by student teams. These teams consist of pedagogical university students, future teachers, and polytechnic university students, future engineers. It concludes that interdisciplinary training of students from pedagogical and engineering universities in the electronic educational resources design on computer modeling for school primary engineering learning is effectively feasible using distributed educational technologies.

 abstract = {Factor graph, as a bipartite graphical model, offers a structured representation by revealing local connections among graph nodes. This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.},

Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model.

Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students},

The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students},

In particular, AGI ventures into human-level cognition, and expands to thinking, reasoning, and awareness. This imminent evolution is envisioned to be manifested through the embodiment of AI machines, allowing machines to transcend their purely computational nature and interact with the world through the different senses. Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.},

We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.},

 abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.},

 abstract = {In In fact, this era has been marked at a crossroad of technology and creativity, amalgamating and bringing up the revolutionary peak in the contemporary landscape of literature due to the induction of artificial intelligence into the production and analysis of Indonesia literature. This paper tries to outline the evolving relationship of human expression with machine intelligence—in other words, it tries to answer how AI algorithms have redefined the landscape of Indonesia literature from creation to critique. This paper will discuss firstly the historical development of AI in literature from a seed idea to its present sophisticated application. It is against this background that the paper explains how this has been done through a comprehensive review of existing literature. It brings out the way AI has become a collaborator and a provocateur in the creative process by making it possible for humanity to create poetry, prose, and narrative structures. This paper will delve into a few of the most telling examples and casuistries into exactly how AI-generated literature differs—from the level of its stylistic tendencies to the quantity of its thematic preoccupations. The research will also analyze the impact of AI on literature analysis and interpretation. Even canonical works were given new keys to be read with the help of advanced algorithms in text and sentiment analysis, and their light was shed on contemporary texts too. Below, the following sections, is a survey of some of the ways AI-driven methodologies have only augmented traditional literary analysis, allowing scholars to draw patterns, themes, and even nuances of language that may escape ordinary human perception.},

This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. “The true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.},

Our primary conclusions are that students are interested in using ChatGPT in the context of education and that there is no significant difference in the tasks they use it for depending on their academic major. Students use the tool more commonly for topics relevant for their fields and the average satisfaction with the tool grows the more frequently students use it, meaning ChatGPT, like other tools, is learnable.},

The scientific community thinks the Solovay-Kitaev theorem a mile-stone in quantum compiling - the task of computing gate-circuit approximations - because it proves the existence of efficient quantum compilers in an analytic sense. However, since we cannot represent unitary operators in a mere analytical way on digital computers, contemporary digital implementations of quantum compiling resort to heuristic numerics and remain below the computational performance engineers hope to realize using the result of Solovay and Kitaev. This paper discusses quantum compiling within a framework of computable analysis, establishing a concept of computable unitary operators for digital computing based on the theory of Turing machines. Particularly, we prove that digital quantum compiling is uncomputable due to the underlying algebraic structure. Finally, we discuss several implications of our findings for heuristic digital implementations of quantum compiling, hinting toward possible research directions to thoroughly understand the relevant bottlenecks.},

Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.},

However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.},

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs. For example, immersive game design may effectively enhance creativity and problem-solving skills.

To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity.

The Vertex Cover problem, a fundamental challenge in graph theory, finds significant relevance in the context of the compute continuum, where the optimal placement of application images across a diverse range of computational resources is a critical concern. Our proposed TLAV-based algorithm addresses this challenge by leveraging local information at each vertex to make intelligent decisions, thereby reducing the global complexity of the problem. While this approach could potentially lead to resource overprovisioning, we argue that in the context of the compute continuum, this trade-off can provide more flexibility and redundancy, enhancing the reliability of the system.

Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.},

 abstract = {Constrained by the finite depth of field (DOF) in optical cameras, imaging devices face difficulties in achieving complete sharpness across all objects or areas within the same scene. Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) technology has emerged in response to this challenge. This technique combines complementary information from multiple partially focused images to generate an all-in-focus fused image. The fully clear image is the foundation of subsequent visual tasks. However, existing methods rarely focus on the fusion of image sequence, even though image sequence are more common in practical scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a novel MFIF generative model based on transformer encoder, termed as SPAFusion. We think that MFIF should focus on patches from the same regions within the source images. Therefore, the attention mechanism of our model is based on patches. We further introduce a shift patch mechanism to integrate long-range dependencies. Benefit from the patch attention and shift patch mechanisms, our model boasts a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity compared to existing transformer-based MFIF models. Additionally, the introduction of the shift patch mechanism enables the model to integrate long-range dependencies, allowing it to incorporate both intra-domain and cross-domain contextual information. Finally, we employ pooling to obtain the fused image, enabling our model to support the fusion of image sequence. Experiments show the superiority of our SPAFusion compared to the state-of-the-art MFIF models.},

However, the capability of VLMs to “think” from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from ego-centric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink.

Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics.},

 abstract = {The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one’s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google’s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8 \%},

 abstract = {The world is grappling with a serious problem: many young individuals are taking their own lives. There is also a challenge in understanding the rising trend of this tendency. It is essential to explore the reasons driving people of all ages to consider suicide and find ways to encourage them to choose life instead. In the modern era, social media acts as a crucial platform where people share their thoughts, activities, and emotional states. This has led to the consideration of whether analyzing social media posts could help discern whether individuals are experiencing joy or sadness, particularly to detect levels of sadness that could indicate suicidal thoughts. This paper employs artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to analyze the social media posts of individuals to gauge their mental state, specifically targeting signs that might indicate a risk of suicide. The study has found a high frequency of suicidal thoughts among those who appear depressed on social media. This research investigated the possibility to identify the likelihood of someone contemplating suicidal through their online behavior. This research demonstrates the potential of utilizing social media analysis to identify and support individuals at risk of suicide, providing new insights into recognizing and assessing suicidal thoughts and representing a significant advancement in suicide prevention efforts.},

Despite the surprising zero-shot or few-shot ability, it is also required to effectively fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce CaptionT5, a video captioning model that fine-tunes T5 towards understanding videos and generating descriptive captions. To generate a more corespondent caption, CaptionT5 introduces thought-augmented fine-tuning for video captioning, in which a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on thought-augmented video inputs. This resembles the process that human see a video, think of visual concepts such as objects and actions, and then tell a correct and natural sentence based on the thoughts. To automatically generate thoughts, we propose (1) CLIP-guided thought sampling that samples thoughts based on the similarity in an image-text multimodal embedding space by leveraging CLIP. We also propose (2) CLIP-guided caption ranking during decoding for further performance gains. Through experimentation on VATEX, MSRVTT, and YC2 datasets, we empirically demonstrate that CaptionT5 performs competitively against prior-art video captioning approaches without using encoders specialized for video data. Further experiments show that CaptionT5 is especially effective under small number of sampled video frames.},

This study aims to fill the literature gap regarding the use of multiple GAI tools and their effect on academic outcomes via a comprehensive review. A systematic literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines to synthesize results on the potential and drawbacks of GAI in educational domains. We included theoretical and empirical papers that used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs. We have also explored conceptual frameworks and the most creative AI applications with a special emphasis on uniqueness and practicability. Experiences, and Perceptions Concerning To compile the information needed we gathered insights into what students were going through by conducting the survey which contains 200 respondents of undergraduate university students gathering insights into the college students’ experiences and perceptions related to GAI used for educational purposes. At the basic level, GAI comprises areas like personalization, task automation, teacher assistance, and efficiency among others, and respective solutions for the immersion of a learner in learning processes to reform directions. However, it generates plenty of challenges such as the question of assessment integrity, the risk that too much automated grading could overwhelm educational value, and relevantly the veracity of AI-generated content as well as the potential disruption to skills like critical thinking, in addition to data privacy and ethical issues.

The SVM method aims to reduce crime rates through proactive measures based on predictive insights. The RBF kernel handles nonlinear relationships by mapping input features into a higher-dimensional space, allowing the model to capture complex patterns. Initially, data is obtained from the Chicago crime dataset and pre-processed by checking for missing values and performing feature scaling to ensure consistency. Feature selection is conducted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify relevant features from the data. Crime prediction using RBF with SVM is performed efficiently to enhance accuracy. The proposed RBF-SVM model is evaluated using the Chicago crime dataset, achieving a high accuracy of 0.89, a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.82, and an F1-score of 0.85.

An open research question is how such technologies may best lead to such a possible result. To help move one step closer to an answer, we present a portable XR platform, namely CreAIXR, where objects may be creatively defined and manipulated with AI paradigms. CreAIXR leverages web technologies, XR, and generative AI where creatives are immersed in a composable experience, allowing them to collaborate and customize an immersive environment through XR paradigms and generative AI.

 abstract = {In recent years sentiment analysis has become a very important part of natural language processing. It allows us to automatically understand the sentiments of humans and views present in textual data. Due to its highly accurate information acquisition based on the context, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have become well-known in this field, among several different approaches. The main objective of this research paper is to discuss the modeling, procedure of training, and assessment of the performance of a sentiment analysis BERT model and compare its performance with a probability-based traditional Naive Bayes approach. We try to discover how we can fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis tasks, and examine its several model configurations and different ways for pre-processing data. Moreover, we conduct detailed tests on well-known datasets to evaluate how accurately the model identifies sophisticated feelings in various environments. We try to show the efficacy of the constructed BERT model in accurately figuring out sentiment polarity and understanding the nuances of human-like sentences in text with the help of detailed studies and comparing ours with different present approaches. This research demonstrates how sentiment analysis models based on BERT can extend their applications in several domains by paving the way for natural language processing systems to understand sentiments easily and more accurately.},

 abstract = {To enhance the application capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in conceptual design, this study explores how to achieve deep integration between LLM-based agents and concept generation methods using the chain-of-thought (CoT) technique and evaluates its feasibility. Using GPT-4 as a case study, we designed two agents: IntelliStorm (based on the unstructured brainstorming method) and EvoluTRIZ (based on the structured TRIZ method). Thirty participants were recruited, and through two experimental phases spaced one month apart, a comparative analysis of the effects of collaboration groups (human-agent vs. human-human) and concept generation methods (brainstorming vs. TRIZ) on participants’ physiological activation and creative thinking performance were conducted. The results show that the involvement of LLM-based agents can effectively reduce participants’ electrodermal activity(EDA) response levels, indicating a reduction in cognitive load. Moreover, participants maintained their distinct physiological patterns and performance advantages across different concept generation methods. For example, IntelliStorm, like brainstorming, evokes stronger responses to information stimuli, demonstrating superior thinking fluency; EvoluTRIZ, like the TRIZ, exhibits a higher frequency of information responses, showcasing enhanced thinking elaboration. However, originality tends to favor human-human collaboration. The findings confirm that integrating LLMs with traditional concept generation methods is an effective strategy made possible by combining CoT and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies. In the future, LLM-based agents are expected to achieve broader application in the design field by incorporating additional concept generation methods.},

 abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide aerial-terrestrial computing services in close proximity to mobile devices (MDs). However, meeting the demands of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks for MDs poses several challenges, including the demand-supply contradiction between MDs and MEC servers, the demand-supply discrepancy between MDs and MEC servers, the trajectory control requirements on energy efficiency and timeliness, and the different time-scale dynamics of the network. To address these issues, we first present a hierarchical architecture by incorporating terrestrial-aerial computing capabilities and leveraging UAV flexibility. Furthermore, we formulate a joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control problem to maximize the system utility. Since the problem is a non-convex and NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a two-timescale joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control (TJCCT) approach for solving the problem. In the short timescale, we propose a price-incentive model for on-demand computing resource allocation and a matching mechanism-based method for computation offloading. In the long timescale, we propose a convex optimization-based method for UAV trajectory control. Besides, we theoretically prove the stability and polynomial complexity of TJCCT. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TJCCT is able to achieve superior performances in terms of the system utility, average processing rate, average completion delay, average completion ratio, and average cost, while meeting the energy constraints despite the trade-off of the increased energy consumption.},

 abstract = {The two visual cortical streams hypothesis, which suggests object properties (what) are processed separately from spatial properties (where), has a longstanding history, and much evidence has accumulated to support its conjectures. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, conflicting evidence has mounted that demands some explanation and modification. For example, existence of (1) shape activities (fMRI) or shape selectivities (physiology) in dorsal stream, similar to ventral stream; likewise, spatial activations (fMRI) or spatial selectivities (physiology) in ventral stream, similar to dorsal stream; (2) multiple segregated subpathways within a stream. In addition, the idea of segregation of various aspects of multiple objects in a scene raises questions about how these properties of multiple objects are then properly re-associated or bound back together to accurately perceive, remember, or make decisions. We will briefly review the history of the two-stream hypothesis, discuss competing accounts that challenge current thinking, and propose ideas on why the brain has segregated pathways. We will present ideas based on our own data using artificial neural networks (1) to reveal encoding differences for what and where that arise in a two-pathway neural network, (2) to show how these encoding differences can clarify previous conflicting findings, and (3) to elucidate the computational advantages of segregated pathways. Furthermore, we will discuss whether neural networks need to have multiple subpathways for different visual attributes. We will also discuss the binding problem (how to correctly associate the different attributes of each object together when there are multiple objects each with multiple attributes in a scene) and possible solutions to the binding problem. Finally, we will briefly discuss problems and limitations with existing models and potential fruitful future directions.},

In the pursuit of higher success rates in navigation, previous work has typically focused on training embodied agents to push away interactable objects on the ground. However, such interactive visual navigation largely ignores the cost of interacting with the environment and interactions are sometimes counterproductive (e.g., push the obstacle but block the existing path). Considering these scenarios, we develop a efficient interactive visual navigation method. We propose Local Accessibility Prediction (LAP) Module to enable the agent to learn thinking about how the upcoming action will affect the environment and the navigation task before making a decision.

And different interaction penalties are imposed depending on the size of the obstacle pushed away. We introduce the average number of interactions as a new evaluation metric.

To demonstrate this concept, accelerometer and gyroscope data are utilized, with results compared to those from a Complementary Filter providing insight into the sensor fusion capabilities of Fuzzy Signatures. The study also underscores the importance of aggregation operators in Fuzzy Signatures, focusing on the Max and WRAO (weighted relevance aggregation operator) aggregation operators. The potential to employ various aggregation operators or to develop new ones for specific applications is highlighted. The findings indicate that Fuzzy Signatures could be an effective solution for sensor fusion challenges, offering prospects for enhancement and broader application in autonomous systems.},

 abstract = {While Agent-Based Models can create detailed artificial societies based on individual differences and local context, they can be computationally intensive. Modelers may offset these costs through a parsimonious use of the model, for example by using smaller population sizes (which limits analyses in sub-populations), running fewer what-if scenarios, or accepting more uncertainty by performing fewer simulations. Alternatively, researchers may accelerate simulations via hardware solutions (e.g., GPU parallelism) or approximation approaches that operate a tradeoff between accuracy and compute time. In this paper, we present an approximation that combines agents who ‘think alike’, thus reducing the population size and the compute time. Our innovation relies on representing agent behaviors as networks of rules (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps) and empirically evaluating different measures of distance between these networks. Then, we form groups of think-alike agents via community detection and simplify them to a representative agent. Case studies show that our simplifications remain accuracy.},

The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students’ understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students’ self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students.},

 abstract = {Mobile edge computing assisting vehicular networks to achieve collaborative computing is a significant research area, as it can effectively expand the on-board computational resources, thereby improving the responsiveness of vehicular applications and reducing energy consumption. However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because task offloading problems are usually multi-objective optimization problems (MOOP) and NP-hard problems. In this respect, we formulate a new multi-objective model for vehicle-centered task offloading tacking into account the queuing and computing processes of tasks. The minimization of the average delay time, average energy consumption, and average payment cost for each vehicle is defined as a MOOP. We propose an efficient collaborative offloading approach based on task triage strategy and multi-objective optimization to address the model. Specifically, this approach can be decomposed into two stages. First, a task triage strategy is developed based on a comprehensive analysis of task urgency and task criticality to make offloading decisions for triaged tasks with extreme characteristics. Then, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework for the MOOP. Finally, we develop a multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates the associative learning immediate memory strategy and genetic operations to solve the MOOP. Extensive experiments and performance evaluations based on real-world traces of taxis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the approach outperforms six other well-known multi-objective algorithms in solving the MOOP.},

 abstract = {This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper presents an intervention on integrating computational thinking modules into a software engineering course. The national consensus on the significance of computational thinking has prompted the expansion of related educational initiatives over the past decade. Since the definition of computational thinking by Wing in 2006, this concept has gained significant attention within the educational community. Particularly this surge of interest has led to extensive research into its conceptual foundations and subsequent integration into educational curricula since 2013. National initiatives have since emerged to incorporate computational thinking into the educational system. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence and computing systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing demand from industries for a workforce and graduates adept at critical thinking and problem-solving. Aligned with this national movement, our study presents a two-year institutional initiative, aimed at integrating computational thinking into the software engineering program. The software engineering discipline extensively involves design thinking and problem-solving skills. However, we noticed that these higher-level skills are not imparted early in the program to teach students this method of thinking and approaching problems. To bridge this skill gap, we developed a set of computational thinking modules and integrated them into a gateway course in the software engineering program. Over two years, we implemented this intervention in an introductory-level course and evaluated its impact on students},

 abstract = {This work-in-progress, innovative practice paper describes the design and implementation of a computer programming project that encouraged students to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT). This innovative practice was implemented at a state university in an introduction to programming course. Course assessments included weekly homework assignments, an open-ended project, one quiz, and three midterm exams. Students were explicitly told in class and in the syllabus that no AI was allowed for weekly homework assignments; however, students were encouraged to use AI for the open-ended project. This decision was made because the problems on weekly assignments were more structured and could be easily solved by AI tools. In comparison, the learning objective of the project was focused on code design with open-ended requirements making it harder for AI to provide workable code. Students who reported using AI indicated that they used it to help start the project and/or a piece of the project and to aid in debugging or finding errors. Project grades were similar to grades seen in previous years for similar projects; however, grades on midterm two, which occurred after the project, were surprisingly higher than the grades for midterm one and higher than exam grades from previous years on similar topics. At this point, we do not know if/how the project contributed to these improved exam scores. Given the success of the project in its first implementation, Dr. E plans to use the assignment in future semesters. Additionally, Dr. C plans to collect data to begin exploring how the use of AI tools in this open-ended project supported students},

 abstract = {This innovative practice paper describes a work in progress on creating and applying educational games that develop mathematical and computational thinking within the project Science&Math educational games from preschool to university - SciMaG. Using educational games, especially in STEM fields, is an effective way to engage students and promote key skills across different age groups and environments. Such activities promote problem solving, logical thinking, strategic planning, and other important skills and can be used with students of different age groups in the classroom, in extracurricular activities, or at home. STEM science outreach activities organized as part of science festivals and similar events can be an excellent opportunity for a game-based approach. However, organizing events for large numbers of participants can pose a logistical challenge in terms of volunteer availability. This paper presents the results of a study in which game-based activities to develop mathematical and computational thinking were integrated into a science outreach event for primary school students on the occasion of Pi-Day. The innovative aspect of the approach is reflected in the use of a combination of games (commercial, newly developed games, and games inspired by commercial ones) which have an interesting math basis and require mathematical or computational thinking skills as well as in the introduction of peer teaching through attracting high-school students as volunteers for the organized event. In the evaluation of the approach, the perceptions of the primary school students (Ns=295), their teachers (NT=19), and the high-school students participating as volunteers in the organized event (Nv=11) were examined using a questionnaire-based study. All groups of participants responded positively and confirmed educational potential of the games. Results confirmed that the activities were well-received and that such events have the potential to enhance learning experiences in STEM. The results also provide valuable insights and motivation for further development of educational games within the SciMaG project.},

This proposal seeks to guarantee the possibility of assimilating learning between lines and between years of study, guaranteeing connectivity between the teaching teams of the interdisciplinary faculty, between the lines of the curriculum, and between students, inside and outside their formal studies and the classroom. In this way, we provide not only the development of technical skills but also contemplate one of the significant challenges in engineering education, which is the development of socially relevant engineering curricula, thus strengthening the intrinsic motivation and adaptability of the student. In the face of the ongoing transformations in the engineering field - especially considering the rise of Industry 4.0 - professionals in this area must get an inter and trans disciplinary education, in close touch with society and industry needs. This calls for educational practices that stimulate entrepreneur development, dynamical skills, and traditional technical knowledge. In this work, we propose the 4D CV framework based on hybrid teaching and new trends in teaching and learning based on active methodologies, seeking to train a future professional who acts as an active agent in society, capable of facing the challenges of Engineering in the 21st century. We create learning environments that allow for (i) the development of capacity and motivation for teamwork in a technical, multi, and interdisciplinary way; (ii) a creative environment aiming for a comprehensive education along with entrepreneurial spirit and ability to innovate; (iii) reflection and discussion that favor independent critical thinking; (iv) actions that strengthen the university},

 abstract = {This innovative practice WIP paper describes how undergraduate students developed their curriculum development skills while designing an after-school program for learning computational thinking through writing. DEPICT (Discovering Computational Thinking through Creative Writing) is a pioneering project aimed at integrating computational thinking (CT) principles into high school (HS) creative writing (CW) classes. Developed by computer science (CS) undergraduate students, DEPICT for Out for School Time (DEPICT4OST) introduces a set of 16 innovative lessons designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and algorithmic reasoning through the medium of CW. This WIP presents an exploration of the undergraduate experience in apprenticeship in the K12 outreach instructional space, crafting the DEPICT curriculum and the transformative journey of teaching others through the creation of engaging hands-on activities. Data was collected through pre- and post program surveys, classroom observations, and student work samples to assess the impact of the DEPICT program. The analysis involved comparing quantitative survey results, coding qualitative data from observations and students reflections, and evaluating changes in student work to determine the effectiveness of the program in achieving its educational goals. Drawing upon their expertise in CS and passion for creative expression, the undergraduate team embarked on the task of bridging the seemingly disparate domains of CT and CW. Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, iterative design processes, and pedagogical research, they developed a diverse range of lesson plans that seamlessly integrate computational concepts into writing prompts, narrative structures, and story-telling techniques. The practices of DEPICT4OST build upon a departmental emphasis on student ownership of outreach activity, which will be described in the paper. The paper explores the challenges of adapting complex computational concepts for HS students and aligning activities with educational standards. It also highlights the creative solutions the undergraduate team developed to make these abstract principles accessible and engaging through interactive writing exercises, group discussions, and multimedia presentations. Furthermore, the paper explores the pedagogical insights gained through the hands-on experience of teaching the DEPICT curriculum to HS students. The undergraduates reflect on their role as facilitators of learning, the impact of active learning techniques on student engagement, and the evolution of their teaching practices. By sharing anecdotes, student feedback, and reflections, the paper offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of infusing CT into CW education. In conclusion, DEPICT represents a pioneering initiative that harnesses the interactions between CT and creative expression to enrich HS education. The paper not only documents the development of the DEPICT curriculum but also underscores the transformative potential of collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to education. Through the exploration of the under-graduate experience, it offers a roadmap for future endeavors seeking to innovate in the realm of STEAM education.},

 abstract = {This work-in-progress research paper presents the preliminary results of a study exploring the effectiveness of using computational notebooks to enhance student learning in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students. Our previous work has shown that students often face difficulties in grasping abstract concepts from mechanics of materials while simultaneously learning computational modeling. However, students recognized several advantages of using MATLAB for FEA compared to manual calculations, including significant time savings, increased efficiency, and reduced errors. Nevertheless, they also faced challenges, including a steep learning curve for MATLAB and concerns about how this limitation hinders their conceptual understanding. Despite these drawbacks, they recognized the importance and value of developing computational skills for their future careers. In this study, we extended the scaffolds and changed the sequence of activities to address the challenges the students faced in the previous iteration of our work. Specifically, we provided worked examples that students needed to use, self-explain, and modify before they engaged in programming from scratch. Also, after developing a basic understanding of how to implement FEA in MATLAB, the students used ChatGPT to generate a code that would do the same task. This activity required them to evaluate and refine automatically generated MATLAB code, as ChatGPT may provide alternative solutions that might not always work correctly. We explore three main topics to understand student experiences with and perceptions of this approach: (1) the value of using computational methods compared to manual completion for FEA; (2) the challenges and support of using MATLAB for FEA; and (3) the effectiveness of simulation tools to learn FEA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) supporting student learning of intricate phenomena explored in mechanics of materials, like distribution of stress, and stiffness, and (2) fostering essential computational thinking skills through practical disciplinary coding experience. By implementing these elements, the study anticipates a substantial improvement in students},

This paper presents a multimodal content generation (MCG) system that seeks to ease the content production process by providing integrated solutions for video, image, audio and text content production among others. Large language models (LLMs) have shown a great promise in enhancing the creativity process in various fields such as media and education where mediums of communication interweave. The system takes into account the current data, situation, user needs, and composes an appropriate and suitable content for them. At the same time, conventional AI models, such as transformers, are combined with multimodal models enhanced with optimization strategies such as transfer learning and fine-tuning. This strategy greatly augments the content generation potential and scalability of the system and thus, is of great importance in the design of systems for the content production process. The quantum- inspired elements of the hybrid model are the ones targeted towards making changes in decision and feature selection within the creative processes. The effectiveness of MCG in this research was compared to other content creation systems, and the results of the research revealed that MCG is more creative, efficient, and satisfying for the users than the existing systems; therefore, it has a great potential for changing the practices of producing content in a multimedia environment.},

Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

The above two-step process of expansion and testing is developed here using the best-first search (BFS) on an OR-tree, where the nodes denote trial solutions (new creations) and edges represent parent-child connectivity satisfying the rules of the given problem domain. Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program. The relative performances of the two algorithms are compared in the context of their applicability. Performance analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors with respect to three important metrics. The proposed algorithms have successfully been employed in developing chapter-end exercises for trigonometric identity proving problems.},

 abstract = {Recent work showed that large diffusion models can be reused as highly precise monocular depth estimators by casting depth estimation as an image-conditional image generation task. While the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results, high computational demands due to multi-step inference limited its use in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that the perceived inefficiency was caused by a flaw in the inference pipeline that has so far gone unnoticed. The fixed model performs comparably to the best previously reported configuration while being more than 200x faster. To optimize for downstream task performance, we perform end-to-end fine-tuning on top of the single-step model with task-specific losses and get a deterministic model that outperforms all other diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models on common zero-shot benchmarks. We surprisingly find that this fine-tuning protocol also works directly on Stable Diffusion and achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models, calling into question some of the conclusions drawn from prior works.},

Rather than traditional hierarchical structures, agile organisations are built around smaller, autonomous teams where shared goals and responsibilities prevail.

There is no doubt that accurate traffic paragon prediction is crucial for effective intelligent transportation systems to some extent. However, current methods are beset by two main challenges: inadequate modeling of intricate traffic dynamics and limited hardware capabilities at the edge.This study introduces MSTF-Net, a novel framework that integrates diverse neural network architectures using adaptive fusion techniques. We propose a two-layer filtering approach after thinking thoroughly: one layer leverages static geographic boundaries, while the other adapts to dynamic traffic conditions. In terms of the practical meaning, this method deeply enhances computational efficiency while preserving prediction accuracy. For the innovative part, we developed a variable-precision FPGA implementation for the BiLSTM component, expeditiously balancing computational accuracy and energy efficiency for real-world applications. Evaluations on the PEMSD4 dataset demonstrate that MSTF-Net outperforms existing approaches, achieving an RMSE of 28.2 for short-term predictions (15 minutes) and maintaining robust performance over longer times. Compared to traditional fixedprecision methods, the reconfiguration strategy for the BiLSTM module reduces energy consumption by 2.8 times. This optimized implementation achieves 5.6 times higher power efficiency, in contrast to equivalent GPU-based execution. This paper presents a comprehensive hardware-software co-design methodology, offering practical insights for developing efficient traffic systems, making it less affected by the constrained traffic resources.},

However, there is a lack of valid and reliable assessment instruments aimed at assessing the acquisition of Concepts, Practices, and Perspectives of CT. This work aims to develop an assessment instrument for the acquisition of CT to the target audience of primary school graduates, and to carry out its theoretical evaluation using semantic analysis and content analysis. The proposed assessment considers the dimensions of Concepts, Practices and Perspectives of CT. Based on a previously designed operational definition of CT validated by an expert panel, we developed a test bank of questions with 117 items in total, of which 63 items were from the Concepts dimension, 45 items were from the Practices dimension and nine scenarios were from the Perspectives dimension.

 abstract = {Gamification has proven to be an effective tool in enhancing engagement and learning across various disciplines, particularly in complex fields like computer science and project management. This paper explores a novel approach to teaching foundational concepts in game design, algorithmic thinking, theory of computation, and project planning through the use of card-based games. By blending gamification with pedagogical strategies, this approach simplifies complex topics and foster interactive, hands-on learning experiences for students and professionals alike. The central problem addressed by this research is the challenge of engaging students with abstract or technical concepts, such as algorithmic logic, regular expressions, and project management methodologies. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods often struggle to maintain interest and facilitate deep understanding in these areas. As a solution, card games offer an interactive, visual, and structured way to present these topics in a more accessible and enjoyable format. The gamified approach encourages participation, reinforces learning through repetition, and provides immediate feedback, all of which are key elements in promoting student success. This paper outlines the design, implementation, and testing of four card games, each focused on a specific educational domain. The game-on-game design introduces students to core principles like mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics (MDA) through a series of design challenges and player interactions. The game on algorithmic thinking encourages players to solve problems step-by-step, mimicking the logic flow found in programming. For the theory of computation, a card game based on regular expressions and automata theory allows students to practice building and recognizing patterns. Finally, the game on project planning introduces learners to critical project management tools such as task delegation, resource allocation, and time management, using a scenario-based gameplay structure. The effectiveness of these card games was evaluated through a series of classroom activities involving students in computer science and project management courses. Results indicate that the gamified learning environment significantly improved students},

 abstract = {To attract students to undergraduate courses is an important topic in Engineering, and this work should be developed during elementary or high school with an emphasis on the connection between the topics presented and solutions in the form of real-world problems. The emergence of the term STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) emphasizes the importance of including Arts and Design as an important relationship with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Maker activities can be used to create tangible objects and provide students with an understanding of the relationship between mathematical topics and real-world objects. Maker culture is often associated with robotics and devices with computational capabilities as a way to develop computational thinking skills for elementary and high school students. In addition, maker education can also be related to the design of these objects and can be used to make students understand how these design decisions relate to realworld issues, from the choice of material used to the scale of the object. This paper proposes to present mathematics content in elementary and high school with the support of maker education to provide students with an understanding of concepts and the connection of these topics with real-world objects. During the learning process, students develop models where they are encouraged to think about how to develop an abstract idea by creating an object in the real world, letting them understand the need to learn abstract concepts and also the decisions that result in a good project. Maker education can be used for self-study and to develop students skills, but it can also be used to provide teamwork and the integration of diverse students during the learning process.},

 abstract = {While women remain underrepresented in STEM fields, our study reveals insights from an overlooked frontier: preschool classrooms. Despite decades of global initiatives aimed at increasing female participation in technology fields, gender-interest stereotypes continue to discourage girls from pursuing computer science careers. Our research challenges these barriers by implementing an innovative educational program integrating Computational Thinking (CT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with $N=114$ preschoolers, we assessed the impact of hands-on activities in algorithms, debugging, and control structures through the TechCheck questionnaire. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions: while initial CT skills showed no gender disparity (boys M=58.8, girls M=53.95, p=,445), post-intervention results revealed girls significantly outperforming boys (girls M=66.11, boys M=51.61, $p=,022$). On the contrary, AI literacy assessments showed complete gender parity (p=,995). These results suggest that early childhood education could be the key to dismantling gender barriers in computer science, demonstrating that when learning environments are equitable, girls not only match but can exceed traditional performance expectations. This study opens new pathways for understanding how early educational interventions can reshape the future of gender equity in STEM fields, beginning with our youngest learners.},

Utilizing various types of stimulus materials is considered a significant method to alleviate design fixation. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technologies, designers can efficiently access a variety of inspirational stimulus materials. However, research on how to best combine multiple types of stimulus materials to mitigate design fixation is sparse. This study combined two types of stimulus materials—text and virtual models—and experimentally explored the impact of stimulus timing (synchronous, virtual model before text, and text before virtual model) and combination forms (matching and mixed) on design fixation. The results indicate that presenting the physical model before the text in a mixed sequential manner effectively alleviates design fixation.},

This paper proposes an Asynchronous Task Offloading Scheme (ATO-S) that allows each CAV to choose an independent optimization period and provides robust task offloading services under unknown vehicle mobility probability distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate asynchronous and robust multi-node cooperative task offloading in dynamic VFC-enhanced IoV scenarios. Furthermore, we formulate the long-term energy consumption minimization problem of VFC and transfer it into each time slot problem by Lyapunov optimization. Then we design Asynchronous Task Offloading Algorithm (ATO-A) to jointly optimizing CAVs matching, communication and computation resource allocation, and transmission power based on multiple mathematical techniques and hybrid heuristic algorithm. Extensive simulations based on real-world traffic scenario are conducted by varying multiple crucial parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the energy efficiency and task queue stability achieved by ATO-A, and service robustness achieved by ATO-S, in comparison with benchmark solutions.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based agent approach for optimizing prompt-based mathematical problem-solving in language models (LMs). The system follows an agent-based evolutionary approach, where a single cognitive prompt undergoes iterative mutation and selection based on solution quality. A problem-solving agent generates solutions, a fitness evaluation agent scores responses without ground truth access, and a correctness verification agent terminates evolution upon identifying a correct solution. Evaluated on the MATH500 benchmark with the Llama 3.2 3B model, our approach demonstrates that evolutionary cognitive prompting (EvoCP) improves accuracy and accelerates convergence, highlighting the potential of EAs for improving LM reasoning in mathematical domains. The solve rate increases from 0.15 to 0.85, showing that EvoCP enables a compact LM to achieve significantly higher problem-solving capabilities.},

 abstract = {In the domain of deep learning for visual tasks, ensemble models combine several less accurate models to form a more precise composite model, improving overall performance. Traditionally, majority voting and average probabilities have been the main decision-making techniques in ensemble learning, focusing only on the TOP1 Class of base models, hence overlooking other significant information. This article introduces a new algorithm, TOP2 hybrid decision (TOP2 HD), which enhances the TOP1 accuracy of the ensemble model. TOP2 HD categorizes base models into hierarchies based on their TOP1 Class and uses the TOP2 Class for ranking, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that TOP2 HD not only surpasses traditional ensemble methods, such as majority voting, average probabilities, and stacking, but also exceeds many of the latest ensemble strategies in the image domain. In addition, our experiments revealed a functional relationship between the test accuracy of the ensemble model and the number of base models. This enables us to predict the upper limit of the ensemble model’s performance using only a fraction of the models, providing a crucial reference for the performance after the deployment of the ensemble model.},

 abstract = {This study applies a systems thinking approach to examine the complex dynamics influencing clinicians’ trust in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose a conceptual model that maps how trust in AI evolves in response to key factors such as workload, diagnostic difficulty, AI accuracy, patient outcomes, prior trust in AI, and user expertise. The interrelationships among these variables were synthesized from existing literature to explore hypothetical scenarios, rather than to predict specific outcomes. The data used in this study are assumed to be tabular in nature, with analytical challenges arising from inherent uncertainties affecting both humans and AI. Using simulation-based analysis, we observed that clinicians’ trust in AI decreases as diagnostic difficulty—both for the AI system and the human clinician—and clinical workload increase. Interestingly, trust remains relatively stable under rising workload when diagnostic tasks are simple but significantly declines when tasks are complex. Clinician expertise emerged as a critical moderating factor. Experienced clinicians tend to maintain higher trust levels in AI systems, even under challenging conditions, compared to their less experienced counterparts. This may be attributed to their enhanced ability to detect AI errors, allowing for more calibrated and resilient trust. These insights highlight the importance of designing AI systems and training interventions that support appropriate trust calibration, especially in high-pressure clinical environments. Our findings suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fostering trust in AI may be insufficient. Instead, targeted strategies that account for diagnostic complexity and clinician expertise are essential. This work contributes to the broader understanding of trust dynamics in clinical AI adoption and offers practical guidance for developers and healthcare organizations seeking to optimize human-AI collaboration.},

 abstract = {High-power microwaves (HPMs) are short-pulse electromagnetic waves in the microwave spectrum, characterized by intense impact energy that can cause damage to both electronic devices and human organs. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of data-driven artificial intelligence paradigms, achieving intelligent protection against HPM has emerged as a critical research challenge. The key to enabling intelligent analysis of plasma-based HPM protection lies in accurately modeling the complex multiphysics interactions between HPM and plasma. Existing methods have made progress in predicting the response of plasma characteristic parameters (such as electron density and electric intensity) under HPM exposure and in imputing missing values. However, it primarily focuses on short-term variations of single-feature variables. In this work, we propose a novel time-series modeling approach that integrates multiperspective feature extraction with multihead attention-based information fusion, complemented by an autonomous thinking strategy (ATS). This framework enhances the precise capture of long-term multivariate time-series patterns, and our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. Furthermore, this study specifically investigates the coupling effects between HPM and a cylindrical plasma array (CPA). By conducting case studies and comparing our method with three state-of-the-art time-series models, we validate the superior accuracy and generalizability of our proposed approach.},

 abstract = {Cooperative embodied AI systems, where multiple agents collaborate to accomplish complex, long-horizon tasks, show significant promise for real-world applications. These systems integrate perception, cognition, and action through integrated task and motion planning (TAMP), leveraging the advanced reasoning and communication capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, their efficiency is often hindered by challenges such as high computational latency and redundant communication, largely due to the reliance on LLMs for sequential planning decisions. In this paper, we aim to identify the inherent characteristics and optimization opportunities in cooperative embodied AI systems. We first present a cognitive-inspired modular framework encompassing perception, memory, communication, planning, and execution. We then conduct a detailed profiling analysis of two state-of-the-art cooperative embodied systems, revealing the significance of each module and identifying critical bottlenecks such as redundant message pre-generation and excessive LLM usage in decision-making processes. Based on these insights, we propose several model- and system-level optimizations, including a planning-first communication strategy, selective multi-agent communication, and planning-guided multi-step execution. Evaluated across long-horizon cooperative tasks, these optimizations reduce the frequency of LLM inference runs, achieving an average 3.93× speedup in end-to-end task execution. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential directions for embodied AI computing, to enhance system flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.},

However, research examining the association between students’ attitudes toward STEM learning and their CT skills remains limited, particularly among lower primary school students. To address this gap, the present study adapted and validated an existing STEM Learning Attitude Scale for use with lower primary students in mainland China. The adapted scale was then employed to assess students’ attitudes toward STEM learning and to examine the relationship between these attitudes and their CT performance. A total of 171 second-grade students participated in the study. The psychometric properties of the adapted scale were evaluated, and the associations between students’ STEM learning attitudes and CT performance were analyzed using correlational analysis and linear regression. The findings confirmed that the adapted scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing STEM attitudes among young learners. Furthermore, students’ STEM learning attitudes were positively associated with CT performance, with mathematics learning attitudes exhibiting the strongest relationship. These results underscore the importance of promoting positive STEM attitudes in early education, particularly toward mathematics, to support the foundational development of CT skills.},

This study introduces a method designed to address this issue. Two primary types of thinking are examined: “Imagining” under divergent thinking and “Inference” under convergent thinking. The approach relies on a crucial transitional mechanism emotional assessment. By evaluating the emotional impact of ideas generated during the “Imagining” phase, those evoking positive emotional reactions are prioritised and linked to the “Inference” phase, where these ideas are refined into practical applications. This strategic use of emotional evaluations as a bridge between divergent and convergent thinking phases offers a structured pathway that enhances both the generation and implementation of creative ideas in computing, representing a theoretical and practical advancement in the field.},

This study presents a novel AI-driven framework tailored for garden design, synergizing symbolic formalism with neural generative modeling to support the synthesis of complex, context-aware landscape artifacts. Traditional garden design often relies on fixed templates or heuristic rules that limit adaptability to environmental constraints and stylistic variations. These methods struggle with semantic coherence and lack responsiveness to evolving cultural and ecological aesthetics. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dual-component system comprising StyleMorphNet and the Semantic Stylization Protocol (SSP). StyleMorphNet is a multi-branch neural architecture that decomposes the generative process into latent subspaces covering spatial structure, material composition, and stylistic innovation. This modular design supports fine-grained control over layout generation while preserving landscape semantics. Complementing it, SSP embeds domain-specific knowledge—including seasonal dynamics, functional zoning, and regional styles—into the generative loop via rule-conditioned modulation and symbolic-visual reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our framework produces garden designs with superior spatial harmony, stylistic diversity, and ecological relevance compared to existing models. This work contributes to the field of computational landscape design by providing an adaptive and semantically grounded framework that supports the co-creation of expressive, sustainable outdoor environments.},

 abstract = {Today, students face complex problems that require critical thinking skills, closely aligned with computational thinking concepts. It is increasingly important for students to shift from being passive consumers of content to actively creating content, using technology to address challenges. This shift has driven efforts to integrate computational thinking as a fundamental skill in K-12 educational programs. It is believed by incorporating computational thinking in the curriculum students will be better equipped to take on the challenges of the digital age. This belief is attributed to the fact that computational thinking includes a variety of problem-solving abilities like breaking down tasks, recognizing patterns, simplifying concepts, and thinking algorithmically. This study employs a systematic thematic synthesis approach, combining diverse research methodologies and using thematic analysis to explore effective strategies for assessing computational thinking in non-programming contexts. Literature advocates embedding computational thinking in K-12 education not only to prepare students for STEM careers but also to equip them with essential skills for problem-solving and decision-making in everyday life. The results indicate using assessments that combine short practical tasks along with multiple-choice and short-answer questions, offer an effective way to measure computational thinking skills, ensuring comprehensive evaluation and meaningful learning outcomes.},

 abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is increasingly recognized as a foundational skill in the 21st century and has been extensively incorporated into K–12 education. As a key component of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, fostering CT development is often considered a critical objective. However, limited research has examined the influence of students’ attitudes toward STEM learning on their CT development, particularly among young elementary school students. To address this gap, the present study investigates the relationship between attitudes toward mathematics learning (M) within STEM education and CT performance, focusing on mathematics, as it is the primary STEM subject introduced at this age. A total of 134 second- and third-grade students participated in the study. The psychometric properties of a revised mathematics learning attitude scale were examined, and correlation analysis combined with structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to explore the relationships among mathematics learning attitudes, mathematical skills, and CT performance. The results indicated that the revised scale was a reliable assessment tool for measuring mathematics learning attitudes for this age group, and findings from SEM revealed that mathematical skills act as a mediating factor, linking positive attitudes toward mathematics learning to CT performance. This study highlights the dynamic interplay among mathematics attitudes, skills, and CT development in young learners, offering implications for educational practices and future research directions.},

In this activity, middle school students program Ozobots (mini-robots used to teach coding) to model delivery routes for Amazon.com packages, a task that mirrors real-world challenges. The students combine coding skills with real-world problem-solving, gaining practical experiences that will serve them well in the future. Students will focus on the logistics when they create and refine delivery paths using block-based coding while tackling challenges like traffic patterns, delivery priorities, and route efficiency. The lesson encourages creativity, logical thinking, and collaboration while introducing key concepts in robotics, logistics, and computational thinking. Additionally, students critically analyze the societal implications of logistics systems by comparing synthetic and natural materials, with a focus on sustainability and ethical considerations. Societal influences further connect to the impacts of computing standards in a way that relates how individuals and communities affect computing by how they behave, interact culturally, and engage socially. This approach enhances STEM literacy and cultivates a deeper understanding of the interplay between technology, logistics, and societal needs. It is also an interdisciplinary lesson addressing science, computer science, engineering, and mathematics standards. By integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, students can see the real-world connections between these subjects, encouraging a deeper understanding and preparing them for the complex challenges of the future. These lessons enhance their academic growth and inspire creativity and collaboration, essential skills for success in the rapidly evolving world.},

 abstract = {The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.

 abstract = {This study proposes a novel deep learning framework for predicting the aesthetic appeal of abstract artworks, bridging the gap between subjective visual judgment and objective computational modeling. We introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture enhanced by contrastive learning, which jointly captures absolute and relative aesthetic cues. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset comprising over 5,000 abstract artworks, enriched with aesthetic scores derived from a fusion of crowdsourced evaluations, expert ratings, and predictive proxies. Optimization is performed using a Lookahead-Rectified Adam (RAdam) strategy to ensure fast convergence and generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ViT model outperforms traditional CNN-based models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet by margins of up to 20% in R2 score and 15% in MAE. Key performance metrics include an F1 score of 0.87, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10.0, and an R2 score of 0.92. Additional analysis using scatter plots, Taylor diagrams, and violin plots confirms strong alignment with human judgment. The originality of this work lies in its mathematically grounded architecture for abstract aesthetic evaluation, its integration of contrastive loss for relational understanding, and its interpretability pipeline using attention-based visualization. The proposed model has applications in generative design, art recommendation, and creative AI interfaces.},

This problem is generally not convex because of the scaling constraint. By exploring the special structure of this joint optimization of the choice of the realizations and the computational resources to be applied, and under a scaling assumption, the ESP is converted to a convex problem. Numerical results are given which compare this method with existing approaches.},

The paper discusses a simplified MAP receiver for Bluetooth GFSK signals. Laurent decomposition provides an orthogonal vector space for the MAP receiver. As the first Laurent waveform contains the most energy, we have used only this waveform for our (simplified) MAP receiver. This receiver requires a E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of about 11 dB for a BER of 10/sup -3/, required by the Bluetooth standard. This value is about 6 dB better than single bit demodulators. This performance is only met if the receiver has exact knowledge of the modulation index.},

 abstract = {Many advances in automatic parallelization and optimization have been achieved through the polyhedral model. It has been extensively shown that this computational model provides convenient abstractions to reason about and apply program transformations. Nevertheless, the complexity of code generation has long been a deterrent for using polyhedral representation in optimizing compilers. First, code generators have a hard time coping with generated code size and control overhead that may spoil theoretical benefits achieved by the transformations. Second, this step is usually time consuming, hampering the integration of the polyhedral framework in production compilers or feedback-directed, iterative optimization schemes. Moreover, current code generation algorithms only cover a restrictive set of possible transformation functions. This paper discusses a general transformation framework able to deal with nonunimodular, noninvertible, nonintegral or even nonuniform functions. It presents several improvements to a state-of-the-art code generation algorithm. Two directions are explored: generated code size and code generator efficiency. Experimental evidence proves the ability of the improved method to handle real-life problems.},

The legal language, denoted K, is global, but it can also be expressed as the parallel composition of two languages, K/sup 1//spl par/K/sup 2/, where K/sup i//spl sube/L(G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/), i=1,2. There are two communicating agents that simultaneously run (online) identical versions of the algorithm but on different models and legal languages: agent i, i=1, 2, operates on subsystem G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/ and legal language K/sup i/. We show that this scheme achieves the same behavior as the sequential VLP-PO algorithm, but at a total execution complexity that is significantly lower; this algorithm generates maximal observable and controllable sublanguages of the given legal language K.<>},

In the present work, a criticality evaluation index model of the locomotive is established and the Monte Carlo simulation method is employed to obtain the criticality priority of the railway locomotive components. Based on the analysis and method, a program for general calculation is developed and applied to the criticality analysis on DF4D locomotive. The case showed that this method is an effective way to evaluate the criticality of the components of the railway locomotive. In addition, the new method of evaluation of criticality is more objective and suitable for practical situations since the analysis, for example, demonstrates that the equipment components with low failure rate have a high criticality priority. Furthermore, the method is convenient by employing Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, this improved analysis method on the criticality analysis has a practical impact on making decision for the maintenance mode of complex equipment, i.e., railway locomotive.},

Common approaches suggest a straight-forward encoding by assigning each point on the board to a single (or more) input neurons. However, these basic representations do not capture elementary structural relationships between stones (and points) being essential to the game.

The strength of the trained networks is evaluated in games against three computer players of different quality.

Synthesis strives to achieve unity and meaning of knowledge; it is necessary for resolving contradictions, concentrating will and for purposeful actions. Synthesis connects language and cognition. Its main mechanisms are emotionality of languages and the hierarchy of the mind. Differentiation and synthesis are in complex relationship of symbiosis and opposition.

 abstract = {The application of Grid technology is at the transition from engineering and natural science-related industrial sectors to other industries that have a high demand for computing resources. However, the diffusion of Grid technology within industrial sectors which are not naturally engineering and natural science-related is often hindered by a lack of incentives to share the computational resources. A promising way to overcome these barriers is the introduction of economically inspired mechanisms for the use of Grid-based resources. Our work introduces a iterated cost-based multi-unit resource auction (CMRA) and compares a traditional cost-based accounting approach with dedicated servers as well as a pooling approach with regard to service quality and total costs. The cost-calculus used in our model is based on costs for the delayed processing of jobs and costs for the cancellation of these jobs if the job cannot be provided at a certain time span in the worst case. The simulation results indicate that pooling of IT resources by Grid technology can produce a reduction of 20.3% in cost within this model compared to dedicated servers in the computing centers. However, with the CMRA-based allocation of computing resources, a further 1.4% of cost reduction can be achieved while the achieved quality-of-service (QoS) can be significantly increased. Finally we think that there must be a further cost reduction potential for Grid solutions beyond these savings that can be achieved by using economically inspired allocation methods that are combined with advanced refining and learning methods.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop an intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism for computer generated forces (CGF). The proposed CGF can take actions similar to a human pilot to gain an advantageous status over the enemy target using the intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism. The mechanism will produce the best multi-step tactics combination (MSTC) for the CGF in an air combat environment. The MSTC is composed of CGF’s decision space. In this paper, based on our previous work, we propose a predictive multi-step fuzzy inference system (PMSFIS) as the automatic maneuvering mechanism for CGF, which incorporates and mimics human thinking capability and the maximum capacity of CGF. Before PMSFIS executes the fuzzy inference system (FIS) process, it will generate a list of MSTC, and allows CGF to predict its future posture corresponding to the list of MSTC. This paper assumes that CGF can accurately predict an enemy target’s future position, then PMSFIS applies the predicted data to generate the best MSTC. We verify the proposed algorithm with a set of fighter flying data that is used as the enemy target’s flying trajectory. The simulation of the proposed algorithm shows that PMSFIS will enable CGF to obtain the best status in an air combat environment and improve the performance of our previous work.},

Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in the literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation web-based learning system call HINTS to further facilitate students},

 abstract = {A very interesting and promising numerical method of solving systems of ordinary differential equations based on Taylor series has appeared. The potential of the Taylor series has been exposed by many practical experiments and a way of detection and solution of large systems of ordinary differential equations has been found. Generally speaking, a stiff system contains several components, some of them are heavily suppressed while the rest remain almost unchanged. This feature forces the used method to choose an extremely small integration step and the progress of the computation may become very slow. There are many (implicit) methods for solving stiff systems of ODE’s, from the most simple such as implicit Euler method to more sophisticated (implicit Runge-Kutta methods) and finally the general linear methods. Usually a quite complicated auxiliary system of equations has to be solved in each step. These facts lead to immense amount of work to be done in each step of the computation. These are the reasons why one has to think twice before using the stiff solver and to decide between the stiff and non-stiff solver.},

Specifically, this model has to be capable of handling the vague interactions between different types of involvement. We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions.},

To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code.

Basic computer education in college should be promoted to information technology literacy education, which students’ information technology literacy and practice ability will be strengthened. In this scheme, the teaching process is divided into three stages: basic information technology literacy education, application ability of information technology literacy education, information technology literacy of specialty education. And modularized courses are prepared for students in each stage. The detail of corresponding lecture and experiment curricula system is also researched.},

In order to investigate the mismatch problem in region-related concept detection, we introduce three kinds of methods to annotate the datasets, and then conduct experiments on differently annotated training and testing datasets. We find from these experiments that the detection performance is the best when the regions of a region-related concept are well defined and matched during training and testing, or the detection performance will be decreased. Based on these observations, we propose a fusion scheme to combine the results of classifiers trained with datasets which are annotated by different methods. Experiments on Trecvid-2007 test corpus show that the proposed fusion scheme can obtain performance improvement up to 6~12%.},

However, traditional teaching of public psychology makes students feel it very difficult to understand and think psychology is not useful in reality. In order to change the situation, we produce a cooperative-learning model based on network for public psychology in university. This teaching mode involves a series of procedures, that is, fixing on study units and objectives, organizing learning groups for cooperative study, constructing web study environment, monitoring and guiding throughout the study process, providing feedback and appraisal for cooperative learning as well. In a word, with the tools of e-mail, ICQ, QQ, BBS, the cooperative-model in public psychology based on web helps to facilitate students},

This paper presents some new teaching methods of Digital Image Processing in an application-oriented college. In classroom presentation, more vivid illustrations and less formula derivations are given. While in laboratory exercises, students are instructed to develop some basic image processing functions commonly used in daily digital lives. This acts as a main clue for the whole course: with the progress of classroom teaching, various image processing features are gradually added to the softwares developed by students themselves. Following these methods, students are stimulated and remarkable teaching results are achieved.},

These models lead to the following results. To get higher throughput efficiency of the waveguide, the periodic wavy thickness of the inlet can provide better inlet coupling with laser diode light, and the wavy taper shape can improve the propagation efficiency. As for plasmon generators, the model requires waveguide, recording media and main-pole to estimate the correct performance, because the optimized design depends on all of these parts. Our proposed sharp pointed plasmon generator can provide tiny near field spot, and it must have good scalability for narrow track recording. In addition to these optics models, we performed recording process simulation. As a result, depending on the condition of the thermal spot and head field alignment, either thermal or magnetic field can be dominant in creating the final magnetic transition in the media. The signal to noise ratio and the transition curvature are greatly affected by the recording process.},

Comparing modelling paradigms based only on the conceptual model specifications is not enough; rather a well-defined benchmarking process and the execution of experiments are required. A benchmarking strategy is applied to three models of an oil refinery supply chain, using the agent-based or equation-based paradigm. Despite the different paradigms, the models share the same assumptions and model boundaries and an attempt is made to provide same initial conditions and stochastics. The benchmarking process shows that clear definitions of the modelling paradigms are needed to avoid confusion and to enable mining of specific and guiding conclusions from the benchmarking studies. Agent-based models and equation-based models rely on different modelling attributes: The first are mostly identified by the model elements (i.e. individuals) while the latter are mostly identified by the system description elements (i.e. equations). We present a way to visualize this and to add nuance to the choice of labels to allow for the conclusions of the benchmarking study to be generalised beyond the models that are compared, to learn about the advantages and shortcomings of modelling paradigms. Finally, some misconceptions regarding agent-based modelling are identified. The lessons learnt apply to supply chain domain but are extensible to other domains.},

 abstract = {Intelligence in engineering systems is expected to gain much more attention during the next years than presently because making interdependent decisions along contextual chains by an engineer increasingly requires reproduction of earlier decisions by other engineers. While a single decision on an object parameter or parameter group in a product structure may be influenced by several humans, humans are strictly responsible for their decisions. The only way is development of transparent intelligent engineering procedures those are capable for representation of humans. The above features of engineering tasks do not allow application of closed procedures from the conventional knowledge engineering and computational intelligence. The authors are engaged in application of knowledge based methods in intelligent engineering. This paper starts with purposeful characterizing of intelligent engineering features in current industrial product modeling systems. Following this, it discusses possibilities for adding intelligence to current product modeling processes. An earlier proposed method by the authors in modeling of human intent driven engineering objectives and contextual connections as entities to assist decisions is applied. Finally, the authors propose a possible way to capture human thinking process element in order to establish intelligent content in product models. The starting point of the proposed modeling is current modeling functionality of industrial product lifecycle management systems widely applied in aircraft, car, house appliance and other industries.},

Firstly, pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on the dynamic programming is introduced where the optimal alignment of two sequences could be acquired by tracing back the similarity matrix which is constructed according to characters in two sequences using dynamic programming algorithm. Second, we think of pixel gray value of all homonymy epipolar lines in two images in turn as two string sequences, and then disparity of corresponding point in two images is calculated by the number of gaps inserted the optimal alignment in every two string sequences. Additionally, according to epipolar constraint we can know that homonymy epipolar lines in two images parallel to the scan-lines, so the 2D matching of images is simplified to that of 1D. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach is stable and efficient, and it has a high matching accuracy and low computational complexity.},

 abstract = {Simulation of biological spiking networks is becoming more relevant in understanding neuronal processes. An increasing proportion of these simulations focuses on large scale modeling efforts. Unfortunately the size of large networks is often limited by both computational power and memory. Computational power constrains both the maximum number of differential equations and the maximum number of spikes that can be processed per unit time. Memory size limits the maximum number of neurons and synapses that can be simulated. To solve for the computational bottleneck, a neuronal simulator is implemented on a CUDA-based General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU). CUDA provides a C-like environment to harness the computational power of specialized video cards from NVIDIA (these cards provide a computational peak power on single precision floats of 1TFLOPS, at least an order of magnitude higher than the fastest CPU). To solve for the memory bottleneck, a just-in-time synapse storing algorithm is implemented requiring only 4 bytes per synapse. Only the synaptic weight is stored, while both post-synaptic contact and delay are recomputed at run-time. This allows a resource shift from memory to computation which fits with the peculiar GPGPU architecture, where an abundance of compute nodes access the memory via a bandwidth-limited bus. Neurons are represented by a single compartment whose activity is modeled by the Izhikevich formalism. Excitatory synapses are plastic and follow both a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and a short term potentiation/depression rule. We are able to simulate networks with up to a million neurons and up to 100 million synapses on a single GPGPU card. Networks of this size cannot be simulated on desktop computers. For smaller networks the speedup obtained is at least of an order of magnitude compared to traditional CPU platform. As an example of possible use of the present work we present preliminary results on the simulation of early stage of the visual pathway. In the retina, Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC) project to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). LGN projects to the cortical area V1. V1 projects back to LGN. The network is represented by 100,000 neurons, 10 million synapses, and 32 different morphological classes with >350 topological projections. Input to the network is provided by current injection in the RGC layer. The RGC layer models midget and parasol ganglion cells (representing 80% of the RGC in primates). Each ganglion type is then subdivided into on- and off-center cells for a total of 4 different types of RGC. Training is performed via natural stimuli while testing is done with vertical and horizontal bars. The network average spiking frequency is within biological limits. Testing performed with both vertical and horizontal bars shows each pattern propagating along the network},

In this paper, a data dependency based application description model is proposed, which describes a grid-enabled application via dependency among data items in the application, and much close to the thinking pattern of scientists. Based on this model, a scientific computing oriented grid application description language (SCO-GADL) is proposed, and an engine for supporting its execution is designed and implemented. The extensible plug-in architecture adopted by SCO-GADL and its engine makes them support different grid and non-grid platforms easily. At last, a test shows that grid-enabled scientific applications can be developed easily in SCO-GADL, and executes correctly on the application engine.},

 abstract = {It is recognized that the key theoretical and technical problems toward the next generation internet are not only a speed issue, but also a more fundamental issue of the increasingly demands for the sharing of computational intelligent capabilities. According to cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC) [3, 9, 10, 15], which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics [6, 12], such as concept algebra [7], system algebra [17], realtime process algebra [4, 8], granular algebra [12], and visual semantic algebra [11]. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.},

 abstract = {Abstract rules can be learned by several species (not only humans). We propose a biologically plausible model for same/different discrimination, that can point towards the neural basis of abstract concept learning. By including a neural adaptation mechanism to a discriminator model formerly introduced in the literature, selective clusters of neurons fire depending on whether or not the stimuli compared are the same or not. These selective neurons are consistent with experimental findings in the literature. Moreover, reward and attention can modulate the relative strength of each attribute/feature of the stimulus, so more complex abstract discriminations can be achieved using the proposed model as a building block. As a formal model, it can be easily incorporated into several applications in robotics and intelligent machines.},

Expressing these rules required the use of common computational structures such as conditionals, sets and loops. We analysed the rules written for their structure and style, and recorded the types of errors made. It was found that although young people were able to abstract away from the game play experience, very few of the rules were error-free. The most common errors were errors of omission (leaving elements out that should have been included) rather than errors of commission (including elements which should not be part of the rule). These findings have implications for the design of the Flip language, which aims to support young people as they begin to develop computational skills through game design.},

As a possible contribution to better communication, the author proposed a new information content based extension to currently prevailing product model in the form of a new sector. This paper introduces and discusses a new development in the above mentioned extension in order to establish a contextual chain of model entities from human intent, through objectives for product and contextual connections to decisions.

Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.},

To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.},

 abstract = {Two main recent achievements of the first decade in this new century in model space based during product definition are representation of corporate knowledge in product model and extended application of contextual feature principle. Contextual connections are applied to define corporate knowledge features as relationships amongst product object parameters. Current product models include comprehensive range of contextual features. However, current user interfaces for product definition processes are not in the possession of capabilities for the required human-computer communication and model representation. Coordination of human originated intent and engineering objective definitions for product feature definitions is not available. The authors of this paper introduced a new contextual chain in which human intent, product behavior, and adaptive action objects are connected in order to establish modeling capabilities for the above communication, representation, and coordination. As a realization of this method, new sets of entities were defined to extend currently applied product model entity sets. This paper starts with characterizing and evaluation of the currently prevailing product modeling. Following this, a new model and its entities are introduced and the method of extension of current model with this model is explained. Implementation of the proposed method is facilitated by the possibility for new object class definition by using of open surface of current industrial product modeling systems.},

Traditional undergraduate courses in embedded systems focus on ad-hoc engineering practices and the use of existing modeling techniques, often omitting critical analysis and meta-modeling; we emphasize model-based design of embedded and cyber-physical systems. Students learn how to model the physical world with continuous time differential equations, and how to model computation using logic and discrete models such as state machines. Students evaluate these modeling techniques through the use of meta-modeling, illuminating the interplay of practical design with formal models of systems that incorporate both physical dynamics and computation. Students learn formal techniques to specify and verify desired behavior. A combination of structured labs and design projects solidifies these concepts when applied to the design of embedded and cyber-physical systems with real-time and concurrent behaviors.},

 abstract = {This paper, based on findings in brain organization and cognitive neuroscience, proposed a more low-level and plausible architecture of human cognition, called CAUT, which can demonstrate the diagram and mechanism of human thinking. Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.},

Prototyping is moving to virtual by the application of sophisticated product models for complex simulations. Simulations rely upon knowledge representing experience, expertise and intelligence of engineers in knowledge wares. Increasing proportion of this knowledge is placed in the product model in the form of active rules, checks, and reactions. In case of any change of these knowledge representations, relevant product model entities are modified accordingly. This knowledge must be verified by practice. Consequently, interaction of virtual and physical worlds is anticipated as a main area for future research in product model based virtual engineering systems. The authors developed and published a novel knowledge based method for the definition of product objects during the recent years. In this paper, they conceptualize a possible integration of intelligent sensor networks with active knowledge in product models.

Still some potential paths are left untraveled. This study presents an attempt to model emotions as a complex system based on the hypothesis that mind state can be considered as an emergent phenomena resulting from autonomous, interactive, elementary entities called emotions. Our approach is based on Buddhist philosophical concepts about thought formation by combination of emotions. Multi Agent Systems (MAS) technology has been used for the realization of above emotional model since interactions and emergence are intrinsic features of MAS. Capabilities of the model are exposed via a virtual agent application called EME who perceives, understands, uses and expresses emotions.

The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects.},

A model has been devised that simulates the sound localization performance of normal hearing persons, and that is being further refined for simulation of performance of hearing-impaired persons wearing two cochlear implants (CIs). The model is intended to be a tool in understanding the relative contribution of various factors involved in acoustic localization, and in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies. This presentation overviews the development of and results for the normal hearing model, and discusses modifications that are needed to simulate sound processing with binaural cochlear implants. The human head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of the model, and provides the characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects. It defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues reaching each ear that are important for good localization ability. The model has been validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization in normal listeners, and is being further developed to account for differences in the signal pathway and sound reaching the CI user due to sound processing and microphone location effects.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we explain how an existing computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems was improved and adapted to suit the domain of chess endgame studies. Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.},

 abstract = {Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior.},

 abstract = {As computing technologies develop, there is a trend in traffic simulation research in which the focus is moving from macro- and meso-simulation to micro-simulation since micro-simulation can provide more detailed quantitative results. Moreover, the success of the Artificial societies-Computational experiments-Parallel execution (ACP) approach indicates that integrating other metropolitan systems such as logistic, infrastructure, legal and regulatory, and weather and environmental systems to build an Artificial Transportation System (ATS) can be helpful in solving Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) problems. However, the computational burden is very heavy as there are many agents interacting in parallel in the ATS. Therefore, a parallel computing tool is desirable. We think that we can employ a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which has been applied in many areas. In this paper, we use a GPU-adapted Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to solve the problem of generating daily activity plans for individual and household agents in the ATS, which is important as the activity plans determine the traffic demand in the ATS. Previous research has shown that GA is effective but that the computational burden is heavy. We extend the work to GPU and test our method on an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU for two scenarios of generating plans for 1000 individual agents and 1000 three-person household agents. Speedup factors of 23 and 32 are obtained compared with implementations on a mainstream CPU.},

However, when bottom-up is applied to elicit improvement areas, the method is usually limited to the use of surveys that miss many of the root causes and structural deficiencies.

Those who can foster and take advantage of the creativity while also avoid being trapped by the chaos will prosper. The key to dealing with this inherent tension involves understanding and supporting new approaches to organization, planning, and control. These approaches need to deal with issues of assessing and monitoring business situations; predicting the impacts of alternative ventures, relationships, and investments; and obtaining, deploying, and redeploying resources.

 abstract = {Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.},

 abstract = {Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.},

These issues provoke questions in the academic community as to whether the learning methodology of introductory to programming courses is appropriate. As regards the pedagogical procedure in general, the teacher-centered model was amended with the introduction of Interactive Learning Environments, which promote distributed learning. In this paper, we examine the fundamental skills needed for introductory to programming courses. Additionally, we focus on some of the most popular micro worlds and evaluate them in terms of educational suitability.},

In accomplishing this, we integrated MATLAB/Simulink, the de facto standard for technical computing into the university curriculum for teaching four Computer Engineering courses namely Numerical Methods, Signals and Systems, Digital Control Systems and Digital Signal Processing during the 2010/2011 academic year at the University of Ghana. The course modules were developed in consultation with others and taught over the period of 13 weeks. The semester examinations consisted of laboratory and written exams sessions of three hours duration. After grading and collating of examinations results, it was clearly demonstrated by students that they have learnt the key requirements in engineering education. The statistics was staggering and interesting; for example 90 students registered the Numerical Methods, one withdrew due to ill-health and 89 students passed the seemingly difficult course with good grades.},

 abstract = {Developing database (DB) and data warehouse (DW) applications passes through three main modeling phases imposed by the ANSI/SPARC architecture: conceptual, logical and physical. This architecture creates two different actors: (i) conceptual designers and Database Administrators (DBA). The first actor collects user requirements, chooses the relevant diagrams for designing the conceptual model (or the logical model). The DBA ensures the performance, the maintenance and the tuning of the final application. Most of the tasks performed by these two actors are complex and time consuming for a majority of companies. Recently, some academic and industry research efforts are moving towards truly zero-administration of DW by proposing tools (advisors) substituting some tasks of DBA. One of the functionalities of these tools is to propose recommendations in choosing optimization structures such as indexing, materialized views, etc. They do not guarantee robust solutions. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary economical model for DB /DW application. Instead of substituting the DBA by advisors, we propose to delegate some DBA tasks to conceptual designers like selecting optimization structures. First, we propose to connect user requirements to the conceptual model of the target application. Secondly, based on the analysis of requirements, SQL queries are identified and then used to select optimization structures. Finally, a feasibility of our approach is tested through the selection of bitmap join indexes based on user requirements.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we describe a multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) experiment, situated in a highly immersive CAVE. A subject sitting in the virtual environment controls the main character of a virtual reality game: a penguin that slides down a snowy mountain slope. While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.},

 abstract = {Understanding how proposed medical devices will interface with humans is a major challenge that impacts both the design of innovative new devices and approval and regulation of existing devices. Today, designing and manufacturing medical devices requires extensive and expensive product cycles. Bench tests and other preliminary analyses are used to understand the range of anatomical conditions, and animal and clinical trials are used to understand the impact of design decisions upon actual device success. Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections. We believe that these limitations can be overcome through advancements in data-driven and simulation-based medical device design and manufacturing, a research topic that draws upon and combines emerging work in the areas of Regulatory Science and Big Data. We propose a cross-disciplinary grand challenge to develop and holistically apply new thinking and techniques in these areas to medical devices in order to improve and accelerate medical device innovation.},

A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described. The domain is that of collisions among bodies moving in a straight line, with no frictional resistance.},

Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.},

For many simple control objects, PID control could easily achieve perfect effect, but for some complex object the effect is not so perfect. The submarine maneuver control system is a nonlinear six degree of freedom model, which has the great inertia variational parameters and many other complex characters. It is difficult for single PID to control the system because of the complex characters. In many instances, the best control is obtained in the manual mode using experienced operators. Fuzzy control translates the thinking of experienced operators into control algorithm, which has proven effective for complex, nonlinear, imprecisely-defined model. In order to advance the control effect, fuzzy theory is introduced and simulation experiments are carried out in this paper. The result shows that fuzzy PID control designed for the unstable nonlinear model of submarine maneuver respond more rapidly and robustly than single PID control.},

Many of these challenges stem from the fact that technologies are continually experiencing dramatic change, and savvy customers are increasingly demanding more qualified services.

Aiming at services systems (not only services themselves), this paper discusses the contributions and the potentials for the field of systems theory for Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Thus, SSME can provide suitable referential clues for discussing impacts of systems theory on services research, and systemic thinking can be applied to discuss key issues in SSME.

It also provides a summary of relevant theories and tools applied to services systems at the systems level.

Despite the wide acceptance of modeling benefits, the use of Model Driven Engineering practices remains limited. We present model oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code. In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code.

In the presented method, application of situation control was improved by placing it from the product feature level to the product behavior level. Because the feature level situation control is a proven key technology in product lifecycle management systems, the new behavior level product definition process controls the process of the feature level product definition. This paper starts with a comparison of the feature and the behavior level product feature definition. Following this, the product request, product behavior, and context structure feature definitions are introduced as main elements of the behavior level product feature definition process. Next, a new context structure and its connection with the feature sequence is exampled and discussed. Finally, application of the proposed method in product lifecycle management systems is outlined.},

The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science were used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations on related activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational intelligence and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vague and empirical approach without the support of formal models and rigorous means. In order to fonnally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of t he brain are s ought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics, and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as, inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.},

 abstract = {In recent years, satellite formation flying has become an increasingly hot topic for both the astronomy and earth science communities due to its potential merits compared with a single monolithic spacecraft system. This paper proposes a novel approach based on closed-loop brain storm optimization (CLBSO) algorithms to address the optimal formation reconfiguration of multiple satellites using two-impulse control. The optimal satellite formation reconfiguration is formulated as an optimization problem with the constraints of overall fuel cost minimization, final configuration, and collision avoidance. Three versions of CLBSOs are developed by replacing the creating operator in basic brain storm optimization (BSO) with closed-loop strategies, which facilitate search characteristic capture and enhance the optimization performance by taking advantage of feedback information in the search process. Numerical simulations are carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO), basic BSO, and the three versions of CLBSOs. Comparison results show that all versions of CLBSOs outperform PSO and the original BSO in terms of final results and convergence speed. In addition, CLBSO reduces the computation burden and shortens CPU time to a certain extent in contrast with basic BSO. Furthermore, among the three CLBSO algorithms, the one using the strategy of difference with the best gains the best overall performance, which is inspired by the updating rule in PSO that each particle tends to move towards the individual with the best fitness.},

There are numerous games and each game has a different set of rules and different set of strategies for playing them. Though the design model of the game is similar to a set of particular games of the same domain, still we have to have a different strategic model for every individual game. The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained. This paper proposes a entire new approach in game modelling; more generalized and a more integrated approach.},

 abstract = {This paper is a sequel to “A novel approach to evolutionary computing: an introduction” in which I describe how the modern software can be viewed as a complex adaptive system and how software evolution can be placed or mapped in parallel to the Darwinian Evolution Theory of biology. Calling it a novel approach to evolutionary computing because, instead of working toward genetic computational approaches to biology, it studies complex adaptive systems in software as if software is the same among biological populations that abide by evolutionary theories of biology. This paper explores the relationship between complexity study as a scientific endeavor and systems thinking as a problem solving skill while approaching to generic software solutions, known as Computational Intelligence, to any problem of our interests at hand. The paper argues that skills in systems thinking are critical and applying them may add values to software development activities, especially to large-scale complex software aiming for the high quality and rapid productivity. Examples will be provided to support arguments in the paper.},

It is also one of the main reasons why software systems often lag behind hardware technologies and fail to capture the full potentials of modern day hardware infrastructure, which is mostly parallel and distributed. We need to change the way we think about software fundamentally, and make it, at its most basic level, to work like the physical world works: distributed, parallel, loosely connected, and asynchronous. KnoRBA achieves this by making the basic components of any program, such as a common word processor, to be asynchronous mobile agents. Then through provision of implementation and location transparency it establishes integration across a distributed environment. This extended abstract is an early introduction to the new revision of KnoRBA that makes it efficient in a domain like sensor networks where power and bandwidth are critical factors.},

It leads to changes on system requirements, hoping to improve systems with attractive creativity features. Consequently, creative computing is aroused as an emerging research field in software engineering. Currently, there are researches working on approaches and processes to develop creative software from scratch. However, evolving existing systems can achieve the same purpose, though it is hard to add creativity features to legacy systems by traditional software evolution approaches. Obviously, based on experiences over decades from software community, development from scratch might cause a waste in terms of resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Model Driven Architecture based reverse engineering method for creative evolution. Abstraction techniques are explored, classified, designed and applied in this proposed approach. Meanwhile, details and roles of abstraction techniques were developed for each step. Also, an e-learning system is chosen as a case study to illustrate, validate and evaluate the proposed method. Overall, our work aims to contribute to software evolution methodology and its application creatively.},

Here user identity plays a very important role to uniquely verify or authenticate the individual person. Instead of designing more complex system, which is more expensive and which requires more software and hardware resources, it is essential to think about to bridge the gap which will create a system with simplicity, less costly and efficient, as well as socially acceptable. The factors which highly impact the face recognition system performance are illumination and pose variations. Feature extraction is the key to reach face recognition. In literature various feature extraction techniques are available. The paper presents six different techniques to generate a feature vector by calculating Centric mean and forward and backward diagonal mean and then apply DCT over it which will reduce the feature vector size and yields less computational complexity giving faster recognition.

 abstract = {The complexity of medical problem solving presents a formidable challenge to current theories of cognition. Building on earlier work, we claim that the systemslevel cognitive model LIDA (for “Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent”) offers a number of specific advantages for modeling diagnostic thinking. The LIDA Model employs a consciousness mechanism in an iterative cognitive cycle of understanding, attention, and action, endowing it with the ability to integrate multiple sensory modalities into flexible, dynamic, multimodal representations according to strategies that support specific task demands. These representations enable diverse, asynchronous cognitive processes to be dynamically activated according to rapidly changing contexts, much like in biological cognition. The recent completion of the LIDA Framework, a software API supporting the domain-independent LIDA Model, allows the construction of domain-specific agents that test the Model and/or enhance traditional machine learning algorithms with human-style problem solving. Medical Agent X (MAX) is a medical diagnosis agent under development using the LIDA Model and Framework. We review LIDA},

Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities.

In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to design a computational thinking curriculum standard for K-12 education. The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan},

 abstract = {A number of statistical or grammatical models of natural language have been proposed over the years. All of them work a little bit; none of them work very well. It is easy to make them do something useful; it is extremely hard to make them do a lot more. This ease of initial success has led a number of people to make extravagant claims about computer processing of natural language. The difficulty of extending the success has led a number of people to make equally extravagant claims about what cannot be done with computing systems in natural language. We believe that much, much, more can be discovered through purely syntactic means (the only ones available to computers at present) than has been demonstrated. We also believe that syntax is not sufficient for any kind of understanding of natural language by computing systems, so that these syntactic studies must be augmented with some notion of semantics that relates the syntax to an interpretive context. This paper will describe some interesting and novel mathematical models that allow us to study the syntactic behavior of natural language to a much greater depth than usual, and show how they lead to some interesting experiments.},

 abstract = {Game-based learning environments can deliver robust learning gains and also have a unique capacity to engage students. Yet they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior gaming experience. This is especially concerning in computer science education, as certain underrepresented groups (such as female students) may on average have less prior experience with games. This paper presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can successfully address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, we first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment, and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at serving all students. In earlier phases of the intervention, male students outpaced their female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multi-week classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach may, over time, compensate for gender differences in experience and lead to equitable learning experiences within game-based learning environments for computer science education.},

In this paper, a new approach for the design of medical data classification systems is proposed. The proposed approach makes use of data granulation in training the classifier. Training data is granulated at different levels and data from each level is used for constructing the classification system. To evaluate performance of the proposed approach, a classification system based on neural network is implemented. Four medical datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed approach to other classifiers: neural network classifier, ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier. Results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance of neural network classifier and produces better accuracy and area under curve than other classifiers for most of the datasets used.},

One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students},

On one hand, the model can summarize the core concepts and important principles in computer science and extract the typical thoughts and general methods of solving problems; on the other hand, the model can implement the teaching and learning of computational thinking by means of blended learning. Based on the model, the teachers can teach the problem-solving process by using computer more intuitively and clearly and the students can understand the application of computer knowledge more easily and simply.

In this exploratory research study, it reports the results of a large-scale quantitative questionnaire surveying 42 primary and secondary schools (n = 42) in Hong Kong, where computer programming has not been regulated as a compulsory course in K-12 curriculum. The questionnaire aims to investigate the school belief on coding education and their practical challenges while integrating it into their regular school curriculum. Our results show that there is a trend in the local schools promoting coding education with positive perceptions on teaching and learning. However, teaching challenges are also mentioned in the survey waiting for solutions, such as lack of teachers training and unified curriculum. Therefore, the empirical experiences of these schools have set forth the future research direction in design and implementation of coding education in K-12 classrooms not only in Hong Kong but also in the globe.},

In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated and validated by investigating through capacity, task latency and load balancing of a typical container terminal logistics service case with a comprehensive scheduling algorithm that is a composite of multifarious classical decision thinking and algorithms.},

This automaton has been simulated on the CM-2 Connection Machine using a sequence of logical operations and table lookups to determine the state of a CA site from its old state and those of its neighbors. The logical operations are performed in parallel by each of the Connection Machine processors, while the table lookups use the indirect addressing capabilities among groups of 32 processors. A description is given of CA fluids, including the issue of isotropy, the choice of a rule set, and the averaging procedure used to obtain hydrodynamical quantities. The CM-2 Connection Machine is then described, with emphasis on the indirect addressing capabilities of the machine. A complete description is also given of the Rothman-Keller model for two-phase flow. It is shown how the indirect addressing is used in the simulation algorithm, and how a symmetry in the dynamics is used to reduce the size of the lookup tables by a factor of six. A time sequence of results showing the separation of two immiscible phases from an initially homogenized state is presented.<>},

In this paper, we propose a novel technique to optimally program a reconfigurable RF system in order to achieve maximum performance and/or minimum power. Our key idea is to adopt an equation-based optimization method that relies on general-purpose, non-convex polynomial performance models to determine the optimal configurations of all tunable circuit blocks. Most importantly, our proposed approach guarantees to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex polynomial programming problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems based on convexification. A reconfigurable RF front-end example designed for WLAN 802.11g demonstrates that the proposed method successfully finds the globally optimal configuration, while other traditional techniques often converge to local optima.},

It is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via CPS and IoT are discussed. Moreover, the security issue of the proposed system is also analyzed.},

We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.},

Increased blood viscosity is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Elevated blood viscosity is associated with atherosclerosis and its growth. The knowledge of the arterial hemodynamics resulted due to atherosclerosis with different level of blood viscosity can clarify the relationship between artery stenosis and symptoms, and, finally, the risk of heart attack and stroke. Hence proficient imaging of blood flow has great clinical importance to understand the origin and evolution of disease. Therefore, investigation and detection of viscosity change and its effect might be helpful for better diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. In this simulation work, hemo-disturbances are studied in a carotid artery finite element model (FEM) with atherosclerosis under different viscosities consideration using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The obtained FEM data are used to reconstruct color flow image of blood velocities using ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals to study atherosclerosis detecting the viscosity changes. The findings of this study suggest that ultrasound based blood flow image can detect the viscosity change effect related to atherosclerosis growth. We think the findings will be helpful to develop effective ultrasound imaging technique for atherosclerosis diagnosis.},

The fast mode belongs to the intuitional reaction, and the slow mode represents the complicated cogitation in human brain. This fascinating human thinking concept is inspired by the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, which explains the process of the human brain.

 abstract = {In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender},

The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students.

Achieving efficient parallel simulation of scale-free networks is challenging because large-degree nodes can create bottlenecks that limit performance. To help address this problem we describe an approach called link partitioning where each network link is mapped to a logical process (LP) in contrast to the conventional approach of mapping each network node to an LP. Link partitioning is discussed in the context of packet-level simulations of telecommunication networks. The parallelism of link partitioning relative to node partitioning is examined in terms of an idealized execution using the well-known YAWNS synchronization algorithm. Further, a critical path analysis suggests that there is much more parallelism available in these simulations than can be exploited using the YAWNS algorithm.},

 abstract = {Mobile programming is one of the fastest growing approaches in many fields, such as marketing or e-commerce. From the educational perspective, this means that students should understand that they can build mobile applications (apps) without being professionals, and at the same time recognize their own potential to use technology in any professional path they choose. This goal is not trivial, even if students are in general curious and open to learn about the creation of apps. Indeed, especially in liberal education, students get discouraged upfront as they perceive programming as a difficult task. This paper describes a course that was cre- ated to fit the educational needs of a social-economic high school. Students take part of an interdisciplinary project in which the Software Engineering process is used to promote CT skills. The course was repeated twice and involved 29 students (8th and 9th grade).},

This lightning talk delves into a virtual reality education and entertainment application named Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative user responses measuring cognition, presence, usability, and satisfaction, we hope to find how virtual reality can enhance interest in the field of computer science among middle school students.},

Traditional machine learning technologies deal with object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, and behavior acquisition. This paper presents a supervised machine knowledge learning methodology for concept elicitation from sample dictionaries in natural languages. Formal concepts are autonomously generated based on collective intention of attributes and collective extension of objects elicited from informal definitions in dictionaries. A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base. The results of machine-generated concepts demonstrate that the AMCE algorithm can over perform human knowledge expressions in dictionaries in terms of relevance, accuracy, quantitativeness, and cohesiveness.},

Four tenets of the cyber world present profound challenges for the application of traditional military strategies in cyber conflicts. The cyber world is characterized by the following: 1) a lack of object permanence, which undermines the concept of maneuver; 2) limited or absent measurement of effectiveness in offensive cyber; 3) conflicts that are executed at computational speed, thus removing the time window for meaningful strategic leadership; and 4) anonymity, which makes the parties to the conflict unknown. As a result, the use of traditional military thinking and path-dependent behavior in cyber is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions regarding strategic achievements and abilities in the pre-conflict stage, and increase the risk of strategic failure during conflict and provide an opportunity for an adversary},

The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries.

That is, even if an MLP can provide correct answers, we cannot understand the reasons why it makes these decisions. In this study, we try to interpret a single hidden layer MLP by discretizing the hidden neuron outputs into 3 values (e.g. -1, 0, and 1). The 3 values correspond to false, unknown, and true, respectively. The basic process is (1) train an MLP first, (2) discretize the hidden neurons, (3) retrain the output layer of the MLP, (4) add more hidden neurons if needed, and (5) induce a decision tree based on the hidden neuron outputs. Experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed method is feasible for acquiring interpretable knowledge.},

 abstract = {The celebrated sparse representation model has led to remarkable results in various signal processing tasks in the last decade. However, despite its initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded circulant matrices. While several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In this paper, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as the l0 norm, mutual coherence, Spark and restricted isometry property to their counterparts in the convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment.},

To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.},

In this paper, we present a computational intelligence based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system that helps medical specialists detect and diagnose HCC in its initial stages. The proposed CAD comprises the following stages: image enhancement, liver segmentation, feature extraction and characterization of HCC by means of classifiers. In the proposed CAD framework, a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification methods are introduced for HCC diagnosis. For training and testing, the recorded biomarkers and the associated imaging data are fused. The classification accuracy of the proposed system is critically analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. In addition, laboratory biomarkers are also used to cross-validate the diagnosis.},

 abstract = {Accurate recognition of the meaning of words in the given document fragments has a long historical standing in computational linguistics. Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms.},

We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions.

I argue that, as far as defeasible reasoning is concerned, one should distinguish between practical and ideal rationality. Starting from the adaptive logic framework, I formalize both rationality notions by means of logic games. The presented adaptive logic games are based on (i) standard logic games on the one hand and (ii) dynamic proof procedures for adaptive logic on the other hand. The games are similar to standard logic games, but have the extra property that some moves are revisable. This is handled by means of a main control game, which starts different standard logic games. I argue that the adaptive logic games form intuitive reasoning models for rationality in defeasible reasoning contexts. Moreover, I will also demonstrate that the games give a good insight in the computational complexity of defeasible reasoning forms.},

We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.},

An effective method for delivering character education is problem solving moral and social situations represented visually as animated vignettes.

In this paper, we describe the design, use, and evaluation of a computational tool that enables students to construct their own animated vignettes. By building, sharing, and responding to vignettes, students become engaged in problem solving moral and social situations. Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool’s multimedia features are often used and well-liked. Educators can download and use our tool while researchers can draw upon our design rationale and lessons learned when building similar tools.},

Three major parts to an effective BMI are determined and handled in this paper: classifying a thought, doing a useful activity, and providing an efficient user interface (UI). This paper proposes an effective way of classifying thoughts and an approach for providing useful activities given a sequence of signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.},

 abstract = {Prof. LotfiAskarZadeh had revolutionized the field of logics by proposing a novel logic, Fuzzy Logic, in 1965 where there is smooth transition between different classes due to overlapping of membership functions, and each element in fuzzy set has a degree of membership. Fuzzy Logic was considered appropriate to represent any vague or ambiguous situation of the real life problems. It also has the provision of allowing linguistic variables whose truth values may vary between 0 and 1; in contrast to two values of classical logic. Quite recently, Neutrosophic Logic was proposed by Florentine Smarandache, which is based on non-standard analysis that was given by Abraham Robinson in 1960s. Neutrosophic Logic was developed to represent mathematical model of uncertainty, vagueness, ambiguity, imprecision, undefined, unknown, incompleteness, inconsistency, redundancy, and contradiction that encompasses the shortcomings of every other logic studied in the past. All the factors stated are very integral to human thinking, as it is very rare that we tend to conclude/judge in definite environments, imprecision of human systems could be due to the imperfection of knowledge that human receives (observation) from the external world. Imperfection leads to a doubt about the value of a variable, a decision to be taken or a conclusion to be drawn for the actual system. Multiple factors could lead to uncertainty like incomplete knowledge (ignorance of the totality, limited view on a system because of its complexity), stochasticity (the case of intrinsic imperfection where a typical and single value does not exist), or the acquisition errors (intrinsically imperfect observations, the quantitative errors in measures). This talk would focus on the overlapping regions of the fuzzy systems in which a method has been proposed for using neutrosophic logic and assign a triplet of the form (t, i, f) for the points that are spanned by overlapping ranges, in such a way that every such output is assigned a true, indeterminate and false value.},

In this study an existing model of situation awareness is extended to incorporate mutual trust of the participating agents. The proposed model is analyzed using two different paradigms of computational modeling techniques namely Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Population Based Modeling (PBM). Various experiments are conducted using variety of populations. Results show that with incorporation of trust factor, both approaches show similar patterns with large population size. In addition to that, relation between SA and trust is analyzed and the results show that SA gets affected by the inter-agent trust.},

Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.},

Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems.

Problock is proposed as a tool to (1) develop computational thinking, in a context of learning based on addiction problems, (2) disseminate and motivate students for future professional development in higher education in computer science and disciplines related. In this paper, the results of the construction of the tool are presented and the work in progress in a Chilean school.},

The prospects developed in the area of Project Based Learning Approach, Collaborative Learning and Embodied Programming are taken into account. Surrogate Embodiment, in the Embodied Programming context, is a kind of interaction where the movements performed by a person on a stage are directed by students. Furthermore, it is used as a structuring resource in the teaching process, the development of computational devices, paying special attention to skills development in the area of Computational Thinking. This paper presents a Video Game Development Workshop based on this approach with first year students from a state technical school. The experience has shown satisfactory results in connection to the acquisition of concepts and fundamental practices in the area of Algorithms and Programming.},

This exposes the tradeoff between profit level of network operators and network price of Edge Users (EUs), which is captivated by both the operators and EUs, and allows the operator to handle an optimal economic specification design. We consider the problem of maximum profit with minimum network price problem (MPP) as optimization problem, and present heuristics to obtain the upgrade series optimally. Preliminary outcome presents that the proposed model increases the profit level by 20 % and reduces network price by 30% compared to general edge and cloud platform.},

By comparing model- and human-generated measures of the similarity between pairs of faces, we were able to assess the accord between several automatic face recognition algorithms and human perceivers. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to create a spatial representation of the subject response patterns. Next, the model response patterns were projected into this space. The results revealed a common bimodal structure for both the subjects and for most of the models. The bimodal subject structure reflected strategy differences in making similarity decisions. For the models, the bimodal structure was related to combined aspects of the representations and the distance metrics used in the implementations.},

Ideally, a simulationist estimates the inherent parallelism of a simulation problem to determine whether it is worthwhile to invest resources to carry out a parallel simulation. We propose an analytic method for predicting the simulation parallelism of a simulation problem that is independent of implementation details. We assume that the system to be simulated is modelled as a network of logical processes, and each logical process models a queuing server center. Unlike many analytic models reported in the literature, we consider the causal relations among events in a simulation. Causality effects reduce event parallelism. Our proposed analytic method gives a tighter upper bound on performance speedup. Validation experiments show that our analytic prediction of simulation parallelism differs from that of critical path analysis by 2.9% and 18.8% in open and closed systems respectively.},

 abstract = {The Creative Computing Challenge (CCC) project (2014-2018) is funded by the National Science Foundation and is designed to broaden participation in computing by providing professional development (PD) for high school teachers at Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs throughout the state of New Hampshire. Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.},

The importance of computational thinking is rarely found in K-12 education. Computational thinking is a an important skill everyone needs and it is correlated with many other concepts. These factors have made the development of new tools and syllabus. In this paper, we aim to show the experiments of fractal geometry using MIT Scratch. These computational exercises facilitate to learn many of computational thinking skills that are very important for the people in the near future.

Then the steps of the improved TOPSIS were described. The calculation method of the numerical characteristics of the cloud model used to normalize the decision matrix was given. The separation to the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution was calculated by grey relational analysis method which can reflect the trend relationship between the alternative and the ideal solution. The weight of the criteria was calculated on the basis of the exponential scale of analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method can provide more evaluation information by its statistical nature.},

We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them.

This paper shows how bringing data sources from the creative domain and from hedonic psychophysics together with machine learning and data analytics techniques can overcome this shortcoming to yield a system that can produce novel and high-quality creative artifacts. To demonstrate our data-driven approach, we developed and deployed a computational creativity system for culinary recipes and menus, Chef Watson, which can operate either autonomously or semiautonomously with human interaction. We present the basic system architecture, data engineering, and algorithms that are involved. Experimental results demonstrate the system passes the test for creativity based on the consensual assessment technique, producing a novel and flavorful recipe.

In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human},

 abstract = {Container technology is being adopted to simplify workflow execution. In this paper, we investigate a workflow scheduling policy for container-based systems. A workflow, representing an application, consists of a set of tasks. Each task can be executed in a container within a virtual machine (VM), where the container packaging the function for the task should be loaded into the VM before task execution. To reduce the workflow execution time and the network bandwidth consumption, we propose a cost-efficient and latency-aware workflow scheduling algorithm that strategically loads the containers into VMs and executes the tasks on the VMs. The algorithm is based on “Stretch Out and Compact”, which can stretch out the tasks along the resources by critical path analysis and then find the inefficient slots within the computing resources and eventually compact the tasks into those slots. We introduce a concept of “virtual task” into the algorithm, where container loading is regarded as a virtual task that should be executed before the real task. The introduction of the virtual task can be more effective in finding the inefficient slots for the compaction, thus resulting in a more efficient workflow scheduling policy. Simulation results show that compared to the algorithms that fully or selectively load the dockers, the proposed algorithm can achieve less execution time while saving network bandwidth consumption for loading dockers.},

 abstract = {This Work-In-Progress paper in the Innovative Practice Category presents an innovative model of inter-class peer collaboration that enhances student learning in computing education, and addresses student conceptual gaps. It expands the scope of traditional peer learning beyond the usual classroom setting and motivates student creativity leading to interests in co-curricular professional development. This nifty peer learning model connects computing students from an upper level class with students of a lower level class, so that they can aid each other in a mentor-mentee relationship to address conceptual learning gaps. Existing literature on computing educational research show that several peer learning models have been used in a typical classroom setting for reinforcing learning. However, very few peer learning models have been used in an inter-class setting, and none have been driven by student conceptual gaps in order to create an enhanced learning environment. Our model focuses on developing student interests in further co-curricular professional development opportunities in the form of peer mentoring, tutoring and instruction. Currently, student retention is a significant challenge for computing educators, given the demand of the computing disciplines for an all-round solid knowledge base, including grasping of complex technical concepts. Our approach of inter-class peer collaboration strengthens the learning environment of both lower level and upper level computing courses, and provides much needed support to students, whose knowledge base is still underdeveloped and conceptual understanding is undercooked. This unique form of inter-class peer learning provides upper level students with an exclusive opportunity to reinforce their conceptual grasps by mentoring lower level students. It also enables the lower level students to receive peer guidance for addressing their conceptual gaps. Our improvised peer networking model adds a different dimension to the practice of intra-class peer learning and extends peer learning beyond the traditional bounds. It promotes a new kind of service learning project in classes by encouraging peer mentoring that leads to peer connections across classes. It aids student retention by helping lower level student mentees get over their knowledge limitations. Our work-in-progress research case study indicates that this model inspires peer mentors to engage in out-of-box thinking by challenging them to find creative ways for overcoming conceptual shortcomings of mentees. This, in turn, generates student interests in enhanced co-curricular professional development. Additionally, our ongoing experimental study results show that this model can help in producing a sustainable pool of peer mentors, tutors and teaching assistants, who can become resources plus role-models for other students, and for helping student retention. As part of our in-progress experiments, this model has been deployed within our computer programming classes, where CS2 students have been paired with CS1 students based upon conceptual gaps and knowledge shortcomings. As we conduct these teaching experiments, we analyze the performance of our model through data obtained by conducting student surveys. We discuss these initial collected data and cite them as preliminary evidence in the process of evaluating our model in terms of the improved learning, and generated student interests plus engagement in professional development.},

The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered. The initial evaluation of summative assessment and analysis of a survey result enable us to conclude that the proposed instructional approach increases student engagement, facilitate learning and contribute to the progress of students in this course.},

Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time.

 abstract = {Natural learners must compute an estimate of future outcomes that follow from a stimulus in continuous time. Widely used reinforcement learning algorithms discretize continuous time and estimate either transition functions from one step to the next (model-based algorithms) or a scalar value of exponentially discounted future reward using the Bellman equation (model-free algorithms). An important drawback of model-based algorithms is that computational cost grows linearly with the amount of time to be simulated. An important drawback of model-free algorithms is the need to select a timescale required for exponential discounting. We present a computational mechanism, developed based on work in psychology and neuroscience, for computing a scale-invariant timeline of future outcomes. This mechanism efficiently computes an estimate of inputs as a function of future time on a logarithmically compressed scale and can be used to generate a scale-invariant power-law-discounted estimate of expected future reward. The representation of future time retains information about what will happen when. The entire timeline can be constructed in a single parallel operation that generates concrete behavioral and neural predictions. This computational mechanism could be incorporated into future reinforcement learning algorithms.},

 abstract = {Meditation has been shown to aid with the management of affective disorders through improving emotion regulation. Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.},

This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.},

For this reason, a number of researchers have paid their attention to develop the reasonable analysis method for vessel-bridge collisions in the past twenty or thirty years, facilitating the development of the design methodology of bridge structures under vessel collisions. For example, with the development of the nonlinear contact-impact finite element (FE) technique, the FE-based method has been developed and used in engineering practices. Also, some simplified methods have been proposed based on the nonlinear contact-impact FE technique. Although these methods are capable of clarifying the interaction mechanism between vessels and bridges, they cannot be used to replace the code-prescribed static analysis method due to computational efficiency. Hence, this paper places emphasis on the code-prescribed static analysis method. First, the limitation of the code-prescribed static analysis method is presented by comparing their results with the dynamic results. Then, based on the two degrees of freedom (DOF) system, the equivalent static analysis method considering the load pattern is investigated through the shock spectrum analysis method. This work provides an idea for improving the code-specified static analysis method.},

In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities.},

 abstract = {Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.},

 abstract = {Advances on bidirectional intelligence are overviewed along three threads, with extensions and new perspectives. The first thread is about bidirectional learning architecture, exploring five dualities that enable Lmser six cognitive functions and provide new perspectives on which a lot of extensions and particularlly flexible Lmser are proposed. Interestingly, either or two of these dualities actually takes an important role in recent models such as U-net, ResNet, and DenseNet. The second thread is about bidirectional learning principles unified by best yIng-yAng ( IA ) harmony in BYY system. After getting insights on deep bidirectional learning from a bird-viewing on existing typical learning principles from one or both of the inward and outward directions, maximum likelihood, variational principle, and several other learning principles are summarised as exemplars of the BYY learning, with new perspectives on advanced topics. The third thread further proceeds to deep bidirectional intelligence, driven by long term dynamics ( LTD ) for parameter learning and short term dynamics ( STD ) for image thinking and rational thinking in harmony. Image thinking deals with information flow of continuously valued arrays and especially image sequence, as if thinking was displayed in the real world, exemplified by the flow from inward encoding / cognition to outward reconstruction / transformation performed in Lmser learning and BYY learning. In contrast, rational thinking handles symbolic strings or discretely valued vectors, performing uncertainty reasoning and problem solving. In particular, a general thesis is proposed for bidirectional intelligence, featured by BYY intelligence potential theory ( BYY-IPT ) and nine essential dualities in architecture, fundamentals, and implementation, respectively. Then, problems of combinatorial solving and uncertainty reasoning are investigated from this BYY IPT perspective. First, variants and extensions are suggested for AlphaGoZero like searching tasks, such as traveling salesman problem ( TSP ) and attributed graph matching ( AGM ) that are turned into Go like problems with help of a feature enrichment technique. Second, reasoning activities are summarized under guidance of BYY IPT from the aspects of constraint satisfaction, uncertainty propagation, and path or tree searching. Particularly, causal potential theory is proposed for discovering causal direction, with two roads developed for its implementation.},

 abstract = {The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.},

The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level.},

Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features.

We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.},

 abstract = {Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\circ g$f∘g can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$f and $g$g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even “well-mixedness”, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.},

These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper},

With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer. For this purpose we use a micro-controller, Micro: Bit, and a physical, puzzle-like representation of a programming framework, called MakeCode.},

To our surprise, students started creating complex and lengthy programs to produce original printable 3D objects. We decided to investigate this level of engagement using a questionnaire to collect opinions and experiences from students and a set of metrics to categorize their programming work. The results obtained are presented in this paper along with our conjectures on the causes of the enthusiasm observed with Codeblocks.

 abstract = {Influence maximization is to select k nodes from social networks to maximize the expected number of nodes activated by these selected nodes. Influence maximization problem plays a vital role in commercial marketing, news propagation, rumor control and public services. However, the existing algorithms for influence maximization usually tend to select one aspect from efficiency and accuracy as its main improving objective. This method of excessively pursuing one metric often leads to performing poorly in other metrics. Hence, we think that algorithms for influence maximization should make a suitable compromise between computation efficiency and result accuracy instead of excessively pursuing for one metric. Based on the above understanding, this paper proposes a new algorithm, called Global Selection Based on Local Influence (LGIM). The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is following: if a node can influence another node with large influence, the node also has large influence. Therefore, a two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes is proposed, which can reduce a large number of running time. Moreover, this paper also proposes a new objective function to estimate the influence spread of a node set. In summarize, the proposed algorithm utilizes the two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes to avoid unnecessary computation, and adopts a new objective function to replace time-consuming Monte-Carle simulations. Experimental results on six real-world social networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other four comparison algorithms when comprehensively considering computation efficiency and result accuracy.},

 abstract = {High complexity, meaning a model in which components interact in multiple ways and follow certain local rules, is a huge challenge for brain research. This paper presents a semantic vector-driven closed-loop model, namely THINKING-LOOP, for brain computing to improve the understanding and development of complex cognition. The proposed model is a three-layer fusion of data, information and knowledge with human intelligence, which exploits ontological knowledge modeling, rule-based reasoning and a human-computer interaction mechanism. The interaction and collaboration within the model depend on a pair of complementary schemes in a loop: the top-down scheme from the knowledge layer to the data layer that is used to search for stable cognitive patterns; and the bottom-up scheme from the data layer to the knowledge layer that is used to deeply analyze cognitive functions. As a key factor, human beings participate in the whole learning process of the model, which in turn assists human beings to make decisions. To verify the applicability of the present model in cognitive research, a series of fMRI experiments and analytic methods (e.g. statistical tests and network topology analysis) were conducted. The results show that the proposed model is able to take into account the characteristics of different types of brain patterns and cognitive functions, thereby achieving reasonable decision-making level.},

As a step towards this, we put forward analyzing behavior and task performance at team and/or individual levels by coupling robot data with the data from conventional methods of assessment through quizzes. Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. Although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics.},

 abstract = {This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.},

It helps people to gain more experience from mistakes and thus to perform better in similar future tasks. This paper investigates the counterfactual thinking for agents to find optimal decision-making strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. In particular, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model with a structure which mimics the human-psychological counterfactual thinking process to improve the competitive abilities for agents. To this end, our model generates several possible actions (intent actions) with a parallel policy structure and estimates the rewards and regrets for these intent actions based on its current understanding of the environment. Our model incorporates a scenario-based framework to link the estimated regrets with its inner policies. During the iterations, our model updates the parallel policies and the corresponding scenario-based regrets for agents simultaneously. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments. Experimental results show that counterfactual thinking can actually benefit the agents to obtain more accumulative rewards from the environments with fair information by comparing to their opponents.},

The poster presentation will focus on the first of CT Pathways’ three research questions: How do individual participating League districts define the purpose (“the why”) of CS and CT education, and how do these individual rationales subsequently inform respective district’s intention to offer their students more equitable access to CS/CT content (“the how”)? Results will be reported via baseline pre-survey results from district administrators as well as through follow-up interviews/discussions with select district leads. At this early stage, the primary goal is to help districts align the economic and digital literacy rationales for CS/CT education with the wider social justice and broadening participation considerations they have identified.},

 abstract = {This study discusses a NSF-funded Research Practice Partnership (RPP) to develop and pilot instructional materials for teaching computational thinking to Grades 3–5 students, with a focus on language learners. The study takes place in a U.S. school district whose percentages of Latino/a students, language learners, and low-income students are among the highest in the nation. The project is among the first to examine the linguistic and sociocultural factors that facilitate the success of multilingual students in mastering computational thinking. Utilizing principles of Design-Based Implementation Research in alignment with the RPP approach, researchers worked collaboratively with teachers and administrators to identify problems of practice in computer science education specific to the district. A broad survey of national and regional computer science initiatives was conducted to identify effective approaches for teaching computational thinking to diverse learners. As a result of this survey, the RPP identified a pathbreaking curriculum that aligns with the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 standards to pilot in five classrooms in the first year of the RPP. The curriculum was further revised to align with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and the California English Language Development standards during a week-long summer institute. This paper describes these experiences, highlighting the integration of computational thinking into an English Language Arts curriculum as well as the linguistic scaffolding strategies utilized to better meet the needs of multilingual students. This experience report uncovers pedagogical practices of computational thinking for diverse students and identifies areas for future work.},

Integrating computational thinking and computer science in K-12 classrooms is becoming increasingly essential to the development of a responsible and innovative workforce. Further, with increased recognition of the need for computing competency, workforce development programs that target the emerging workforce that may not be on a college pathway and those citizens who want to retool for the digital economy are also essential. This study examines work by researchers and practitioners in Mississippi to engage all public school students and the workforce with computational thinking, computer science concepts, and cybersecurity, providing pathways for learning that make computing education accessible for all citizens. The state of Mississippi has the lowest median wage in the nation, and one of the lowest rates of STEM employment. With half of the public school children identified as African American, and half of them female, there is much opportunity for broadening participation in computing. Assessments from a K-12 teacher professional development programs will be discussed, in addition to outcomes from one year of a workforce development program.},

 abstract = {This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.},

 abstract = {This study explores interactions between computational thinking, gender and engineering identity among biomedical engineering undergraduate students. Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women’s enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, ‘engineering identity’ has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student’s perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.},

We examined possibility of assessing load and fatigue from measuring brain activity to use NIRS (Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy). We think that measuring load and fatigue is very important for developing user-friendly welfare device. Idea of universal design is widespread in welfare device and system.

Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model.

 abstract = {Many works have been done in an effort to create systems for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes. Although most of them are related to the recipe ingredient lists, few works have been done to evaluate and generate the preparation steps of culinary recipes. This work proposes the use of statistical Language Models, as well as the perplexity metric, for the generation of culinary recipes. In this work, we also developed a system for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes using two approaches: one based on a genetic programming algorithm guided by the proposed language model; and the other based on a decomposition of existing recipes and recomposition of new recipes through a genetic algorithm guided by the proposed language model. This second approach achieved the best results. For this approach, a total of 6 recipes were generated to evaluate, through an online survey, the influence of the Language Model in the generation of recipes with better use of secondary ingredients, oils and seasonings, throughout the preparation steps. In the comparison between these two groups of recipes, the respondents considered the recipes generated using the language model as having the best quality, presenting an average evaluation of 63.6% of the scale (i.e. between medium and good use of oils and seasonings compared to recipes from the other group). In addition, a recipe from this approach was cooked and tasted for taste assessment, obtaining an average evaluation of 93% of the scale.},

 abstract = {The uniqueness of Augmented Reality (AR) is its affordance to support learning abstract concepts by rich information, visualization and the integration of user-content interaction. Research has shown that abstract idea and invisible phenomena can be learned better with the support of AR. However, high complexity and conceptual Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithm design and related programming concepts, are rarely studied empirically in the intersection with immersive technology. This study is aimed at addressing this issue and providing a piece of quantitative and empirical evidence to AR-supported Computer Science discipline-based learning. We designed a mobile AR-enabled application based on a CT framework and related AR affordances in the literature. This app can contextualize a programming debugging task and support program editing & CT learning. A controlled laboratory study was designed and conducted. The result of statistical analyses shows that participants with the AR support made better quality of programs with lower errors and less amount of code edits, compared to those without the AR support.},

Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay. All children perceived the game positively and found it to be a good tool for learning.},

 abstract = {Collaboration is an important feature of scientific practice. Scientists share, discuss and critically argue over different representations of a problem with others when attempting to generate new knowledge. Similarly, collaboration can be beneficial for inquiry-based science learning at school. Successful collaborative learning, however, relies on engaging students in a condition of positive interdependence. In this paper we propose that asymmetric simulations provide an innovative way to establish positive interdependence among students during inquiry learning which will foster the development of their collaboration skills. Asymmetric simulations divide some information or resources necessary to solve a problem unevenly among group members, thereby requiring more equal participation and contribution among all members during collaboration. The asymmetric simulations we developed are available online for free via the Go-Lab portal (golabz.eu) and therefore can be easily integrated into a digital lesson by school teachers. They were created taking into account the small screen sizes of smart devices such as smartphones or tablets, thereby making them convenient for collaborative work in school classrooms.},

 abstract = {Music generation has been an active field of research in computer science and is considered as a creative task attempting to imitate human creativity. With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.},

 abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students},

We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.},

 abstract = {Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-end visual tasks that has remained a topic of interest in various domains. Segmentation of visual scenes was confined to the extraction of object boundaries present in the image data. However, with the progressive developments in technology, machines are expected to produce assistive decisions to aid versatile tasks. Subsequently, these assistive decisions are dependent on efficient results and must project information on a granular level from the visual scenes. The visual scenes are usually of vast variety depending on the scenarios in which the image data is captured. As per recent trends, semantic segmentation is still an open area of research, one of its worth mentioning challenges is to handle the visually adverse images. These visually adverse images are the result of low light/ high light, rain, fog and sometimes in the form of too many objects present in the scene. The study sheds light on the non-trivial problem and diverts attention to the gaps present in literature by providing in-depth critical analysis. This study comprehensively presents unidentified problems prevailing in existing semantic segmentation techniques. A critical literary study is conducted to examine the working mechanics of existing solutions to identify their limitations to produce accurate results for the visually adverse scenarios. The study discusses some of the possible reasons which result in erroneous semantic segmentation results for visually adverse images. Finally, the problems and challenges to be tackled are concluded which highlight the future direction of analysis.},

 abstract = {Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.},

 abstract = {The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) first appeared a few decades ago. Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.},

 abstract = {The authors discuss why the current conceptual base of project management research and practice continues to attract criticism since it does not adequately address the complexity that leads to software-project failure. To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.},

 abstract = {In the music industry, researchers have been developing an approach to music as an informational phenomenon for decades. Interest in music as information becomes especially noticeable with the development of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to determine musical preferences, provide personal recommendations on streaming services, and compose music. Artificial intelligence is predicted to have a strong impact on the music content creation process. Modern music software tools are showing impressive results. However, musical systems based on artificial intelligence lack human intelligence, i.e., the ability to understand the meaning of musical works. Focus on software and insufficient attention to human intelligence indicate that the problem of creating musical artificial intelligence remains extremely underestimated and is one of the urgent problems of modern information technologies. Objective of the research: theoretical substantiation and development of a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. Methods: information and semantic method for the study of cultural exchanges in the musical environment by A.B. Kayak; theoretical analysis of the probabilistic approach to the problem of meaning by V.V. Nalimov; method of probabilistic evaluation of meanings by S.G. Fadushin. Results: the analytical framework is provided for a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. The obtained results will allow to create information and control systems based on artificial intelligence in the musical environment. The information provided in the article may be of theoretical and practical interest for researchers and developers of artificial intelligence in the field of the music industry. The results may also be used by teachers, students, graduate students, researchers studying the philosophy and sociology of musical culture.},

Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.},

 abstract = {This full research-track paper demonstrates growth in computational thinking in a cohort of engineering students completing their first course in engineering at a large Southwestern university in the United States. Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students.},

These four phenomena are closely related to the light-based properties of presence, knowledge, power, and harmony, central to a multilayered light-based model of reality that also offers alternative foundation for thinking about quanta and quantum computation. In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light},

 abstract = {A large number of individuals are suffering from suicidal ideation in the world. There are a number of causes behind why an individual might suffer from suicidal ideation. As the most popular platform for self-expression, emotion release, and personal interaction, individuals may exhibit a number of symptoms of suicidal ideation on social media. Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention mechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual&#x0027;s suicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1) with the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal ideation detection can achieve over 93&#x0025; accuracy; and 2) among the six categories of personal factors, <i>post, personality,</i> and <i>experience</i> are the top-3 key indicators. Under these categories, <i>posted text</i>, <i>stress level</i>, <i>stress duration</i>, <i>posted image</i>, and <i>ruminant thinking</i> contribute to one&#x0027;s suicidal ideation detection.},

Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence.

 abstract = {Scratch is a programming environment, which is widely adopted as the first language to enter the programming world. Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.},

Based on the above discovery, it is suggested that to produce design plans more efficiently, designers refer to suitable precedents in the different design phases.},

 abstract = {Recent studies of creative cognition have revealed interactions between functional brain networks involved in the generation of novel ideas; however, the neural basis of creativity is highly complex and presents a great challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience, partly because of ambiguity around how to assess creativity. We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance—and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT. Our results demonstrate differential patterns of resting-state connectivity associated with individual creative thinking ability, extending past work using a new application to automatically assess creativity via semantic distance.},

While human perception is attracted by visual stimuli, our cognitive capability is derived from the inspiration of constructing concepts of reasoning. Saliency detection has gained intensive interest with the aim of resembling human ‘perceptual’ system. However, saliency related to human ‘cognition’, particularly the analysis of complex salient regions (‘cogitating’ process), is yet to be fully exploited. We propose to resemble human cognition, coupled with human perception, to improve saliency detection. We recognize saliency in three phases (‘Seeing’ - ‘Perceiving’ - ‘Cogitating), mimicking human},

We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software.

Research on CT has gained steady momentum recently, and many of the institutions around the world have adopted CT into their curriculum. This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools. Hence, we plan to analyze the existing assessment methods and propose a new sophisticated tool for evaluating CT skills as our future work.},

Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.},

 abstract = {Reasoning, a trait of cognitive intelligence, is regarded as a crucial ability that distinguishes humans from other species. However, neural networks now pose a challenge to this human ability. Text-to-image synthesis is a class of vision and linguistics, wherein the goal is to learn multimodal representations between the image and text features. Hence, it requires a high-level reasoning ability that understands the relationships between objects in the given text and generates high-quality images based on the understanding. Text-to-image translation can be termed as the visual thinking of neural networks. In this study, our model infers the complicated relationships between objects in the given text and generates the final image by leveraging the previous history. We define diverse novel adversarial loss functions and finally demonstrate the best one that elevates the reasoning ability of the text-to-image synthesis. Remarkably, most of our models possess their own reasoning ability. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with several methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

 abstract = {Despite the great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, large pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2× to 10× with negligible accuracy degradation compared to AL-BERT on various datasets. Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the decision-making process of it in ELBERT. Our code is publicly available online.1},

We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children.},

 abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) contain more biologically realistic structures and biologically inspired learning principles than those in standard artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system’s intelligent nature.},

The most challenging aspect, which is studied throughout this paper, is to understand the meaning of the contract and express it into a structured format. This problem can be reduced to the Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction tasks, the latter handles the extraction of terms and conditions. These two problems are difficult, but deep learning models can tackle them. We think that this paper is the first work to approach Rule Extraction with deep learning. This method is data-hungry, so the research also introduces data sets for these two tasks. Additionally, it contributes to the literature by introducing Law-Bert, a model based on BERT which is pre-trained on unlabelled contracts. The results obtained on Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction show that pre-training on contracts has a positive effect on performance for the downstream tasks.},

Few important things governed by brain are memory, emotions, creativity, intelligence etc. The human mind has three fundamental functions like figure out, react and relish. These functions of the mind are guided by one native egocentrism or potential rational capacities. Egocentric inclination happens involuntarily. ASD better termed as developmental delays. It can cause challenges in social interaction, behaviour and communication. Diagnosis of Autism includes both psychological and neurological examination. Early detection of the neurological markers with the help of MRI can help in to more accurate diagnosis. A combination of S-MRI (Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging), fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and Rs-fMRI (Resting State- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in learning all characteristics of brain. Full brain connectivity and signal intensities of Region of Interest can be acquired using various atlases. ASD destroys the structure of the functional connectivity between the multiple brain regions. Deep learning methods proves to be successful in classification of imaging data. Provided with multi modal details provided by different MRI procedures, using a deep learning network can provide accurate classification results. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks can help in classifying whether the person has ASD or not. Given a FC matrix of the brain it is really huge to differentiate the significant features. Thus, it is requiring for dimensionality reduction. So, the purpose of using deep learning model using MRI is to identify Autism in early stage and to start with therapies.},

 abstract = {Temporal sentence grounding aims to ground a query sentence into a specific segment of the video. Previous methods follow the common equally-spaced frame selection mechanism for appearance and motion modeling, which fails to consider redundant and distracting visual information. There is also no guarantee that all meaningful frames can be obtained. Moreover, this task needs to detect the location clues precisely from both spatial and temporal dimensions, but the relationship between spatial-temporal semantic information and query sentence is still unexplored in existing methods. Inspired by human thinking patterns, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Spatial-Temporal Relationship Inference (CFSTRI) network to progressively localize fine-grained activity segments. Firstly, we present a coarse-grained crucial frame selection module, where the query-guided local difference context modeling from adjacent frames helps discriminate all the coarse boundary locations relevant to the sentence semantics, and the soft assignment vector of locally aggregated descriptors are employed to enhance the representation of selected frames. Then, we develop a fine-grained spatial-temporal relationship matching module to refine the coarse boundaries, which disentangles the spatial and temporal semantic information from query sentence to guide the excavation of visual grounding clues of corresponding dimensions. Furthermore, we devise a gated graph convolution network to incorporate the spatial-temporal semantic information by leveraging a gate operation to highlight frames referred to by the query sentence from spatial and temporal dimensions, and propagate fused information on the graph. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CFSTRI significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the current analysis of the impact of the external environment on emergency repairs is not in-depth, resulting in its model not being able to fully reflect the actual circumstances of the distribution network emergency repairs under the background of disasters, making the actual feasibility of the strategies developed poorly.

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

 abstract = {Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.},

Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode.

The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking.},

Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner.

 abstract = {The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.},

 abstract = {College counselors are an important part of the faculty of colleges and universities, the backbone of the ideological and political education of college students, and the main force in the work of college students. The 21st century we live in is a highly intelligent era. With the continuous emergence of intelligent computing as a typical technical means in contemporary network technology, the relationship between intelligent computing and people&#x0027;s life and work is getting closer and closer. However, college counselors are also facing many new problems and challenges. Therefore, how to improve the use of intelligent computing and better improve the competence of counselors has become a difficult problem for colleges and universities. Based on this, this article launched a research on the competency training ability of college counselors based on intelligent computing. This article uses behavioral incident interview method, literature analysis method and questionnaire survey method to carry out research. Through interviews with counselors, the competency characteristics of counselors are obtained, and the competency model of counselors is established. By consulting the literature, compiling questionnaires, designing a complete set of questionnaires in line with the research, and issuing questionnaires to 60&#x0025; of college counselors and teachers to obtain the most authentic data. Collect relevant data through questionnaire surveys, and then enter the collected data into the database for data analysis. By consulting related materials, using publicly published papers and works at home and abroad as references, we can obtain basic theoretical support and background materials, as well as the current status and development level of the research on the competence of counselors. The survey results show that counselors have a strong understanding of work. Generally, 45&#x0025; are familiar with them, 18&#x0025; are relatively familiar, and few are very familiar. 40&#x0025; of counselors think they have average competence. 44 &#x0025; of counselors voluntarily signed up and wanted to participate in training to improve themselves. 51&#x0025; of counselors believe that the best time for a training session is half a day. Regarding the training goals, only a small number of instructors have clear training goals. It can be seen that the research on the competence training ability of college counselors is of extremely high value.},

As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.},

The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

 abstract = {This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.},

 abstract = {In this Innovative Practice Full Paper, we note that the way software is developed has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.},

 abstract = {This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.},

Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities.

CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices.},

Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged.

 abstract = {Aging may increase the number of failures that underground power distribution cables undergo. Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.},

However, only a part of schools and students are currently learning this programming, and it is not popular enough yet. Moreover, if the teaching is mainly based on the teacher’s explanation, it will be boring. Therefore, there is a need to explore the teaching based on game design and combine teaching with fun, so that learning can become a more acceptable “game” for students, making the classroom atmosphere more active and improving the teaching quality of the classroom.},

A ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) initiative called for a stronger connect with digital technology in formal educational settings in 2012. This was indeed much ahead of its time, as now evident from worldwide move towards digital education in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tracked transformations within learning and teaching for over five years. At the inception of the idea, there was much resistance from parents and other stakeholders; however, the BYOD initiative ultimately showcased a very successful example of technology-supported teaching and learning initiative for other New Zealand schools. Our investigation primarily focused on one of the critical indicators for the success of such an initiative, the digital divide. The digital divide is particularly important because of the level of attention and dialogue this BYOD topic gathered across New Zealand. Initial discourses (over newspapers, radio and television) suggested that this initiative would be damaging in view of existing digital divides across societies and the overall public opinion outweighed the potential positives from such an initiative. As part of our five-year study, we investigated some of the key concerns around the digital divide issue in the context of such a technology-supported learning initiative. One of the key enablers of this study was integration of two frameworks, to enable the cross-examination of relationships between various sources of social cognitive abilities related to an individual’s information literacy, motivational and behavioral aspects. That is, how skill development, knowledge acquisition, and changes in personal and behavioral aspects impact self-efficacy levels as a consequence of BYOD strategies. The resulting framework is especially relevant in post-COVID-19 times, since technology-driven remote education delivery formats are now being touted as the new norm. Our framework will therefore provide much value to policy-makers in establishing inclusive educational policies.},

A totally outsourced genetic algorithm uses both human evaluation and the human ability of innovation. It is a multi-agent environment and the mediator of communication between multiple heterogenous agents. The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems for which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but to find a good representation for them. These qualities allow HBGA to process flows of information without knowledge of its particular structure and representation. The suggested conceptual approach can also be used as a general model and a way of thinking about different kinds of genetic algorithms.},

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.},

In order to expand the thinking of students in the external cultivation class and improve their ability to analyze and solve complex mechanical problems, the research team supplemented the finite element theory for the students in their spare time and introduced the working principle of ABAQUS software. Aiming at the problem of stress and deformation of special-shaped parts proposed by students, the finite element model was established and simulation calculation was carried out by a computer. The simulation results intuitively and clearly show the stress and strain of special-shaped parts, and solve the students’ doubts. The teaching feedback results show that the expansion of finite element theory based on mechanical analysis and the application of ABAQUS software have played an important role in the following three aspects: 1) expanding students’ vision (100%); 2) improving students’ interest in learning (100%); 3) improving the relationship between teachers and students (90.9%).},

 abstract = {This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.},

 abstract = {Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.},

The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science.

To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.},

 abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans.},

However, at present, there is no mature and systematic theory and engineering technology to fully describe massive multi-dimensional semantic expressions of natural language. Then the semantic inheritance and overloading theory was proposed to describe the semantic superposition and synthesis processing of the input vocabularies in this paper. Taking the clause as the basic semantic unit, the semantics were integrated by the local semantics of the clause itself and the global semantics of the cross clauses. The semantic frameworks were represented by the core vocabulary sequence of the clause, and the unified semantic representation grammar of the semantic frameworks to explicitly describe the local semantics and global semantics was studied; From the perspective of big data engineering, according to the unified grammar, the semantic annotation was chose as the initial step, the semantic scene based on the pattern matching of semantic frameworks was divided, the implementation technologies of semantic inheritance and overloading theory between scenes on the base of the observed language representation phenomenon were put forward, and the core algorithms of machine humanoid resolving primary mathematics application problems were realized, the effectiveness of semantic inheritance and overloading theory was preliminarily verified.

 abstract = {From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.},

The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

 abstract = {Promoting the computational thinking of the K12 students through artificial intelligence education is reflected in curriculum standards and academic research. Game-based learning promotes the learning interest and motivation, helps students reinforce computational thinking practices. Based on the input-process-result (IPO) game-based learning model, this study integrated the artificial intelligence instructional content, game-based learning, and the core elements of computational thinking practice to design game-based learning activities that was suitable for promoting computational thinking practices in artificial intelligence courses. In this research, the artificial intelligence course “Challenging Tic-Tac-Toe” was conduct in senior high school. The results showed that the game-based learning in artificial intelligence courses could help students to master artificial intelligence subject knowledge, significantly improved the computational thinking practices, enhanced learning interest, motivation, self-confidence, and reduce cognitive load. Thus, this study provides additional evidence that using the game-based learning strategies is an effective learning method that improves both learning performance and computational thinking practices.},

 abstract = {Whereas the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) shows limited global search ability and be liable to be trapped into local optimum, a double-assimilation of prosperity and destruction oriented improved imperialist competitive algorithm (DPDO-IIC A) is proposed tentatively to overcome inherent defects. The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.},

 abstract = {Music learning is important for preschool children’s musical development, but preschool children are considered to have limited cognitive development and have difficulties understanding abstract musical concepts. Tangible interaction can introduce physical entities into the interaction, allowing children to use their daily life experiences to interact with the computer, reducing the cognitive load and therefore improving the effectiveness of music learning. Combining the cognitive characteristics and physical ability level of preschool children, a design model of a music learning system for preschool children based on tangible interaction is constructed with reference to existing research models, and a set of design recommendations based on this model is proposed. This paper also designs and develops an interactive prototype Music Magician for preschool children to learn music and completes the construction of an interactive action library and iteration of the prototype after pre-experiment feedback. The validity of the prototype is verified through experiments, and the rationality of the proposed design model and design recommendations is also validated.},

 abstract = {Control was from its very beginning an important concept in cybernetics. Later on, with the works of W. Ross Ashby, for example, biological concepts such as adaptation were interpreted in the light of cybernetic systems theory. Adaptation is the process by which a system is capable of regulating or controlling itself in order to adapt to changes of its inner and outer environment maintaining a homeostatic state. In earlier works we have developed a system metamodel that on the one hand refers to cybernetic concepts such as structure, operation, and system, and on the other to the philosophy of individuation of Gilbert Simondon. The result is the so-called allagmatic method that is capable of creating concrete models of systems such as artificial neural networks and cellular automata starting from abstract building blocks. In this paper, we add to our already existing method the cybernetic concepts of control and especially adaptation. In regard to the system metamodel, we rely again on philosophical theories, this time the philosophy of organism of Alfred N. Whitehead. We show how these new meta-theoretical concepts are described formally and how they are implemented in program code. We also show what role they play in simple experiments. We conclude that philosophical abstract concepts help to better understand the process of creating computer models and their control and adaptation. In the outlook we discuss how the allagmatic method needs to be extended in order to cover the field of complex systems and Norbert Wiener},

We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments.

To this end, we introduce E.T. that rE-thinks self-attention computation for Transformer models on GPUs with the following contributions: First, we introduce a novel self-attention architecture, which encompasses two tailored self-attention operators with corresponding sequence length-aware optimizations, and operation reordering optimizations. Second, we present an attention-aware pruning design which judiciously uses various pruning algorithms to reduce more computations hence achieves significantly shorter turnaround time. For the pruning algorithms, we not only revamp the existing pruning algorithms, but also tailor new ones for transformer models. Taken together, we evaluate E.T. across a variety of benchmarks for Transformer, BERTBASE and DistilBERT, where E.T. presents superior performance over the mainstream projects, including the popular Nvidia Enterprise solutions, i.e., TensorRT and FasterTransformer.},

 abstract = {During 2016-19, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded the “Connect Everything: Industrial Systems in the Digital Age” programme (£ 1m) and adopted the German-initiated term “Industry 4.0” for the coming a priori “industrial revolution”. As part of this programme, University of Glasgow hosted the EPSRC’s first conference on this topic - “Looking Beyond Industry 4.0”. The success of this programme led to another round of £ 1m funding for “Connected Everything II: Accelerating Digital Manufacturing Research Collaboration and Innovation” (2019-22), so as “to make the most of this fourth industrial revolution”. The first three Industrial Revolutions took place a posteriori, and mostly, were concerned with assisting and liberating humans from physical labour. Today, should the a priori Industry 4.0 differ from the previous industrial revolutions? If so, would the difference be in a focus on assisting and liberating humans from mental labour for the first time? The recent World Economic Forum highlighted four main design principles of this revolution: (1) Interoperability, (2) Information transparency, (3) Cognitive and physical assistance (4) Decentralised decisions and actions. Coinciding with this wave of revolution is the third wave of artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently in its earnest resurgence. It is now possible to develop computational AI technology to surpass a human designer in innovation and creativity, just like AlphaGo Zero in London to have surpassed AlphaGo and humans in Go playing. The progress of science and technology now heavily relies on simulation-based ‘third paradigm of science’ in the form of ‘computer-aided design’ (CAD). AI can transform CAD simulations to predictive simulations for ‘computer-automated design’ (CAutoD), which becomes possible through AI with the increased computing power and data. Thus, CAutoD should help Industry 4.0 to achieve mass customisation at a mass production cost in the near future. However, design, manufacturing and service all need to be taken into account for factory-floor innovation in order to deliver transformative improvements in performance, productivity and time-to-market. Commensurate with the ‘intelligent manufacturing’ value chain and ‘market informatics’ at the end of this value chain, such Industry 4.0 would enhance innovation, creativity and competitiveness.},

An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems.},

In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking.},

 abstract = {Learning to use computational tools is a critical aspect of many first-year engineering courses. Students in these courses can have varying degrees of prior exposure to computational tools and often exhibit a wide range of intrinsic motivation for learning these skills. Interviews with first-year engineering students were conducted to study the degree to which motivation correlated with intended major within engineering. The pilot round of interviews was conducted in the spring of 2021. This pilot study used the same data set of 8 interviews to progressively refine both the survey and interview collection in the 2021 – 2022 academic year. This paper will review the results of the pilot study and detail the process used to develop and use the finalized protocol and coding schemes for a planned series of 20 interviews in Summer 2022. While this technique developed because of limited data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been beneficial to the researcher and may provide guidance for future researchers.},

 abstract = {This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students},

CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.},

In addition, the discovered resources must also comply with user requests to the diversely available resources along with their current information. In this paper, we aim to explore the resource discovery domain in the area of distributed computing and study the recent proposed schemes.

The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT.},
